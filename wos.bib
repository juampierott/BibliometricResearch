Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management
   (AEC-FM) industry is increasingly affected by digital technologies that
   monitor sensor network data and control automation systems. Advances in
   digital technologies like Digital Twin offer a high-level representation
   of buildings and their assets by integrating the physical and digital
   world. This paper examines patterns, gaps, and trends in the AEC-FM
   sector and contributes to digitalization and automation solutions for
   building management. This work covers a broad range of research topics,
   from intelligent information management of complex models to building
   information management and the interaction of building systems, where
   researchers are increasingly interested in using the Digital Twin to
   manage their information and in developing new research lines focused on
   data interchange and the interoperability of building information
   modeling (BIM) and facility management (FM). After a complete
   bibliometric search of several databases and following selection
   criteria, 77 academic publications about the Digital Twin application in
   the AEC-FM industry were labeled and clustered accordingly. This study
   analyzed in detail the concept of key technologies, including ``Digital
   Twin in Facility Lifecycle Management,{''} ``Digital Twin-Information
   Integration Standards,{''} ``Digital Twin-Based Occupants Centric
   Building Design,{''} ``Digital Twin-Based Predictive Maintenance,{''}
   ``Semantic Digital Twin for Facility Maintenance,{''} and ``Digital
   Twin-Based Human Knowledge.{''} The findings show that information
   standardization is the first major hurdle that must be overcome before
   the actual use of Digital Twin can be realized in the AEC-FM industry.
   Based on that, this paper provides a conceptual framework of Digital
   Twin for building management as a starting point for future research.},

Abstract = {Digital twins aim to virtually replicate the static and dynamic building
   characteristics through real-time connectivity between virtual and
   physical counterparts. Despite its potential, research into digital
   twins for facility management (FM) in multipurpose spaces is at an early
   stage, especially to control and optimize the various uses and
   configuration layouts. One of the major barriers to the adoption of
   digital twin technology in multipurpose buildings is the lack of
   interoperability, primarily between building information modeling (BIM)
   and Internet of things (IoT) data sources. This paper presents a
   possible digital-twin architecture to enable digital-twin applications
   aiming to impact building performance, acting on the facility management
   of stagecraft and variable acoustic architectural elements to control
   the reverberation time in real time. The case study of Roberto De Silva
   Multipurpose Hall is presented, in which the indoor acoustic quality is
   controlled by the digital twin that returns the reverberation time
   output as a function of stage equipment layouts, variable acoustic
   elements and hall occupancy.},

   Diffusion Research},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study aimed to ascertain the research status of complexity issues
   in building information modeling (BIM) diffusion and identify future
   research directions in this field. A total of 366 relevant journal
   articles were holistically evaluated. The visualization analysis
   indicated that management aspects, emergent trends (such as green
   building, facility management, and automation), and theme clusters (such
   as interoperability, waste management, laser scanning, stakeholder
   management, and energy efficiency) are shaping BIM research towards
   complexity. Areas such as supply chain, cost, digital twin, and web are
   also essential. The manual qualitative evaluation classified the
   complexity issues in BIM diffusion research into three types
   (complexities of network-based BIM evolution, impact of BIM adoption
   circumstances, and BIM-based complexity reduction for informed decision
   making). It was concluded that BIM has been shifting towards information
   models and systems-based life cycle management, waste control for
   healthy urban environments, and complex data analysis from a big data
   perspective, not only in building projects but also in heritage and
   infrastructure, or at the city scale, for informed decision making and
   automatic responses. Future research should investigate the co-evolution
   between collaborative networks and BIM artefacts and work processes,
   quality improvement of BIM-based complex networks, BIM post-adoption
   behaviors influenced by complex environmental contexts, and BIM-based
   complexity reduction approaches.},

Title = {Digital twin framework to enhance facility management for relocatable

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {176},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Relocatable modular buildings (RMBs) are gaining recognition for their
   innovation, efficiency, and sustainability, especially in addressing
   urgent needs during natural disasters or pandemics. Their inherent
   flexibility, mobility, and scalability enable rapid deployment and
   adaptation to changing needs. However, managing multiple modular units
   and their relocation and reconfiguration over time presents significant
   challenges. This paper proposes a digital twin framework that integrates
   building information modeling (BIM), the internet of things (IoT), and
   geographic information systems (GIS) to enhance facility management for
   RMBs. Through a detailed case study of a relocatable modular school
   system, the framework's application is illustrated, showcasing its
   ability to streamline lifecycle management of modular construction, from
   initial design and fabrication to deployment, operation, and
   reconfiguration. The results highlight the potential of digital twin
   technology in fostering more sustainable, efficient, and resilient
   modular building environments, contributing to the evolution of smart
   construction practices and adaptive architecture},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mega-facility management has long been inefficient due to manual,
   reactive approaches. Current facility management systems face challenges
   such as fragmented data integration, limited predictive systems, use of
   traditional methods, and lack of knowledge of new technologies, such as
   Building Information Modeling and Artificial Intelligence. This study
   examines the transformative integration of Artificial Intelligence and
   Digital Twin technologies into Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   frameworks using IoT sensors for real-time data collection and
   predictive analytics. Unlike previous research, this study uses case
   studies and simulation models for dynamic data integration and
   scenario-based analyses. Key findings show a significant reduction in
   maintenance costs (25\%) and energy consumption (20\%), as well as
   increased asset utilization and operational efficiency. With an F1-score
   of more than 90\%, the system shows excellent predictive accuracy for
   equipment failures and energy forecasting. Practical applications in
   hospitals and airports demonstrate the developed ability of the platform
   to integrate the Internet of Things and Building Information Modeling
   technologies, shifting facilities management from being reactive to
   proactive. This paper presents a demo platform that integrates BIM with
   Digital Twins to improve the predictive maintenance of HVAC systems,
   equipment, security systems, etc., by recording data from different
   assets, which helps streamline asset management, enhance energy
   efficiency, and support decision-making for the buildings' critical
   systems.},

Abstract = {As the world moves toward a low-carbon future, a key challenge is
   improving buildings' energy performance while maintaining occupant
   thermal comfort. Emerging digital tools such as the Internet of Things
   (IoT) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) offer significant
   potential, enabling precise monitoring and control of building systems.
   However, integrating these technologies into a unified Digital Twin (DT)
   framework remains underexplored, particularly in relation to thermal
   comfort. Additionally, real-world case studies are limited. This paper
   presents a DT-based system that combines BIM and IoT sensors to monitor
   and control indoor comfort in real time through an easy-to-use web
   platform. By using BIM spatial and geometric data along with real-time
   data from sensors, the system visualizes thermal comfort using a
   simplified Predicted Mean Vote (sPMV) index. Furthermore, it also uses a
   hybrid machine learning model that combines Facebook Prophet and Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the future indoor environmental
   parameters. The framework enables Model Predictive Control (MPC) while
   providing building managers with a scalable tool to collect, analyze,
   visualize, and optimize thermal comfort data in real time.},

Abstract = {A smart city digital twin refers to a system designed to digitally
   replicate real-world city objects in a virtual space and implement
   real-time synchronization with the real world, thus helping to solve
   urban problems through various service scenario simulations and data
   analysis processes. In relation to the development of city information
   models for implementing the smart city digital twin, many efforts have
   been made to integrate and utilize BIM-GIS data. However, due to
   problems with the capacity available for storing large amounts of data,
   there are limitations in practical applications because it is sometimes
   difficult to provide numerous realtime services in the era of web
   environments. Therefore, in this study, a lightweighting process for the
   Lightweight Digital Twin System was presented as a method to provide
   various services that a smart city offers based on the digital twin, and
   a lightweighting method was proposed accordingly. The process and method
   were verified through the development of a case application for the case
   of 00 city. It is expected that the Digital Twin System lightweighting
   method proposed in this study will serve as a basis for efficient city
   information processing and contribute to facilitating the provision of
   various smart city-related services.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of technology worldwide in different ways drives the
   construction sector to take the same path. Smart cities, Digital Twins,
   Building Information Modeling (BIM), and the Internet of Things (IoT)
   are the trends in this way today. Also, integrating Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has
   revolutionized how buildings are designed, constructed, maintained, and
   managed. On the other hand, the complexity, high cost, need for
   expertise, and other things make the maintenance process and facility
   management by human inspections, commercial software, and different
   tools not suitable for the growth of the technology. This paper presents
   a proposal for a workflow of integration between BIM, and an algorithm
   of Maintenance System with IoT and highlights its potential to enhance
   building performance and facility management. The paper explores this
   innovative system's underlying principles, benefits, challenges, and
   implementation strategies. Furthermore, it discusses the implications of
   BIM, and the proposed algorithm of Maintenance System with IoT
   integration on various stakeholders, including building owners, facility
   managers, and occupants by using a case study. The findings collected by
   a questionnaire for some experts emphasize the importance of adopting
   this integrated approach to optimize building operations, improve
   maintenance practices, and create sustainable and intelligent built
   environments.},

Abstract = {In the maintenance domain of the construction industry, digital twins
   have been actively introduced based on the technologies of the Fourth
   Industrial Revolution with growing interest in three-dimensional spatial
   information facility management and disaster response service using
   digital twin technology. In particular, disasters or abnormal situations
   in an underground utility tunnel (UTU) can cause serious casualties and
   property damage since key elements of a city such as power,
   communications, water supply, and heating facilities are collectively
   accommodated in a certain underground space. This study established the
   methodology for implementing an underground utility tunnel through a
   digital twin. The novelty of this study is demonstrating a sequential
   procedure of implementing digital twin technology by configuring major
   layers such as data acquisition, modeling, and service. This methodology
   can serve as reference material or a training aid for implementing a
   digital twin of underground facilities or underground utility tunnels in
   the future; the proposed methodology will be verified when an actual
   digital twin service is provided.},

Title = {A BIM-enabled digital twin framework for real-time indoor environment
   monitoring and visualization by integrating autonomous robotics,
   LiDAR-based 3D mobile mapping, IoT sensing, and indoor positioning
   technologies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {86},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Existing indoor environment monitoring methods often fall short due to
   the lack of using standardized evaluation methods, missing spatial
   information, or the absence of user-friendly visualization interfaces.
   To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel digital twin
   framework for real-time indoor environment monitoring and visualization
   by integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things,
   autonomous robot-based mobile mapping and sensing, and indoor
   positioning technologies. The goal is to autonomously monitor indoor
   environmental conditions and provide real-time visualization using a
   standardized assessment index with estimated spatial information in BIM
   software. The proposed framework was demonstrated and validated in two
   indoor scenarios for air quality monitoring and visualizationrelated
   applications. Implementation results revealed that: the framework
   effectively captured spatial characteristics of air quality in small and
   medium-sized indoor spaces and intuitively visualized it using a BIM
   digital twin model; and, the ultra-wideband-based indoor positioning
   system achieved a nearly centimeter-level positioning precision.
   Practical interpretations of the results demonstrated that the proposed
   framework can not only detect and localize the potential sources of air
   pollutants but can also identify the possible causes of low indoor air
   quality. This study ultimately contributes to the body of knowledge by
   offering a novel and generic digital twin framework that seamlessly
   bridges various popular yet previously isolated technologies for better
   informing building facility management-related decisions. This paper is
   the first research work that integrates several emerging technologies
   (i.e., BIM, digital twins, IoT sensing, indoor
   localization/positioning/tracking, and robotics) for advancing real-time
   monitoring and visualization of indoor environmental conditions. While
   the proposed framework was applied for indoor air quality monitoring, it
   could be extended and used for various indoor environmental assessment
   and visualization-related applications.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) and thermal imaging from drone
   flyovers present innovative opportunities for enhancing building energy
   efficiency. This study examines the integration of BIM models with
   thermal data collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assess

   leveraging BIM's structured data and the concept of the digital twin,
   thermal analysis can be automated to detect thermal bridges and
   inefficiencies, facilitating data-driven decision-making in sustainable
   construction. The paper examines methodologies for combining thermal
   imaging with BIM, including image analysis algorithms and artificial
   intelligence applications. Case studies demonstrate the practical
   implementation of UAV-based thermal data collection and BIM integration
   in an educational facility. The findings highlight the potential for
   optimizing energy efficiency, improving facility management, and
   advancing low-emission building practices. The study also addresses key
   challenges such as data standardization and interoperability, and

Title = {BIM-Based Digital Twin and XR Devices to Improve Maintenance Procedures
   in Smart Buildings: A Literature Review},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In recent years, the use of digital twins (DT) to improve maintenance
   procedures has increased in various industrial sectors (e.g.,
   manufacturing, energy industry, aerospace) but is more limited in the
   construction industry. However, the operation and maintenance (O\&M)
   phase of a building's life cycle is the most expensive. Smart buildings
   already use BIM (Building Information Modeling) for facility management,
   but they lack the predictive capabilities of DT. On the other hand, the
   use of extended reality (XR) technologies to improve maintenance
   operations has been a major topic of academic research in recent years,
   both through data display and remote collaboration. In this context,
   this paper focuses on reviewing projects using a combination of these
   technologies to improve maintenance operations in smart buildings. This
   review uses a combination of at least three of the terms ``Digital
   Twin{''}, ``Maintenance{''}, ``BIM{''} and ``Extended Reality{''}.
   Results show how a BIM can be used to create a DT and how this DT use
   combined with XR technologies can improve maintenance operations in a
   smart building. This paper also highlights the challenges for the
   correct implementation of a BIM-based DT combined with XR devices. An
   example of use is also proposed using a diagram of the possible
   interactions between the user, the DT and the application framework
   during maintenance operations.},

Abstract = {Integrating building information modeling (BIM) with Internet of things

   enabling advanced real-time monitoring of indoor environmental quality
   (IEQ). However, technical complexity, proprietary limitations, high
   software costs, and unclear long-term benefits hinder practical
   adoption. This study suggests a way to combine BIM and IoT using open
   standards like IFC and JSON, simple programming tools like Node-RED, and
   secure cloud services. A case study of a six-story office building
   showed that real-time IEQ sensor data can be combined with organized BIM
   information, helping to make better decisions about maintaining,
   replacing, or upgrading heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
   (HVAC) systems. This integration offers essential data needed for using
   advanced analysis techniques, specifically tackling issues with
   compatibility, ease of use, and organizational challenges, which is
   especially advantageous for small-to-medium-sized office buildings.
   Nevertheless, this study faced limitations due to restricted real-time
   data access from existing building management systems and preliminary
   predictive analytic capabilities, highlighting a need for improved
   direct data integration and robust analytical methods in future

   Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Twin (DT), artificial intelligence
   (AI), and blockchain. Yet, facility managers still face challenges
   related to data handling and the actual implementation of these
   technologies. Thus, this paper explores the trends and integration
   possibilities of smart facilities management technologies to provide a
   deeper understanding of the current research state and the areas for
   future exploration. The Scopus database is utilized to collect
   literature data, and a bibliometric analysis is conducted on 7236
   publications of different types, including conference publications,
   articles, reviews, and book chapters, using VOSviewer software. The
   results revealed a noticeable growth in the annual number of
   publications related to this field after 2018. BIM, IoT, and DT were
   seen to share the greatest research attention, with BIM being the
   dominant technology. With recent wide attention, blockchain technology
   is noticed to be introducing many integration possibilities. In
   addition, the prominent contributing authors, countries, and sources to
   this research area are also identified.},

Title = {Digital-Twin-Based Fire Safety Management Framework for Smart Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In recent years, the implementation of digital twin (DT) technology has
   gained significant attention in various industries. However, the fire
   safety management (FSM) sector has been relatively slow in adopting this
   technology compared to other major industries. Therefore, this study
   aims to explore the limitations, opportunities, and challenges
   associated with adopting DT technology in the FSM sector and further
   develop a DT-based FSM framework towards smart facility management (FM).
   To achieve this objective, this research started by reviewing several
   promising DTs for FSM, including building information modeling (BIM),
   the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and
   augmented reality (AR). On this basis, a conceptual framework was
   synthesized in consideration of the benefits of each technology. A
   questionnaire was conducted for FM professionals to evaluate the
   proposed framework and identify the challenges of adopting DT in the FSM
   sector. The survey results reveal that the proposed framework can assist
   decision makers in obtaining comprehensive information about facilities'
   communication among stakeholders. The survey results validate the
   potential of the adoption of DTs toward smart FM practices in FSM. The
   survey results provide insights into the perception of DT technology
   among FM practitioners and identify the current state of DT technology
   in the FSM sector, its expected benefits, and its potential challenges.
   The main barriers to adopting DTs in FSM are a lack of knowledge about
   DTs, their initial costs, user acceptance, difficulties in systems
   integration, education training costs, a lack of competence, development
   complexity, difficulties in data management, and a lack of trust in data
   security.},

Title = {FROM BIM TO DIGITAL TWINS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EVOLUTION OF
   INTELLIGENT BUILDING REPRESENTATIONS IN THE AEC-FM INDUSTRY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {58-83},
Abstract = {The widespread adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the
   recent emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) applications offer several
   new insights and decision-making capabilities throughout the life cycle
   of the built environment. In recent years, the ability of real-time
   connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the
   emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment.
   Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a
   virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction
   process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life
   cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital
   Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there
   is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling
   technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future
   research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the
   development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of
   BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100
   related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In
   order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors
   developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the
   building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital
   Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were
   further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction
   process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In
   addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital
   Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found
   that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully
   exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and
   thus classify under the earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis
   of the reviewed work and the trends in ongoing research, the authors
   propose a concept of an advanced Digital Twin for building management as
   a baseline for further studies.},

Title = {Digital Twin framework for automated fault source detection and
   prediction for comfort performance evaluation of existing
   non-residential Norwegian buildings},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {281},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Numerous buildings fall short of expectations regarding occupant
   satisfaction, sustainability, or energy efficiency. In this paper, the
   performance of buildings in terms of occupant comfort is evaluated using
   a probabilistic model based on Bayesian networks (BNs). The BN model is
   founded on an in-depth anal-ysis of satisfaction survey responses and a
   thorough study of building performance parameters. This study also
   presents a user-friendly visualization compatible with BIM to simplify
   data collecting in two case studies from Norway with data from 2019 to
   2022. This paper proposes a novel Digital Twin approach for
   incorporating building information modeling (BIM) with real-time sensor
   data, occupants' feedback, a probabilistic model of occupants' comfort,
   and HVAC faults detection and prediction that may affect occupants'
   comfort. New methods for using BIM as a visualization platform, as well
   as a pre-dictive maintenance method to detect and anticipate problems in
   the HVAC system, are also presented. These methods will help
   decision-makers improve the occupants' comfort conditions in buildings.
   However, due to the intricate interaction between numerous equipment and
   the absence of data integra-tion among FM systems, CMMS, BMS, and BIM
   data are integrated in this paper into a framework utilizing ontology
   graphs to generalize the Digital Twin framework so it can be applied to
   many buildings. The results of this study can aid decision-makers in the
   facility management sector by offering insight into the aspects that
   influence occupant comfort, speeding up the process of identifying
   equipment malfunc-tions, and pointing toward possible solutions.(c) 2022

Abstract = {Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) represent a significant opportunity to
   reduce building energy consumption and achieve the climate and energy
   goals that will be necessary in the future. Nevertheless, the effective

Title = {Automating construction manufacturing procedures using BIM digital
   objects (BDOs) Case study of knowledge transfer partnership project in
   UK},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {345-377},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to present a novel proof-of-concept framework for
   implementing building information modeling (BIM) Digital Objects (BDO)
   to automate construction product manufacturers' processes and augment
   lean manufacturing.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A mixed interpretivist and post-positivist epistemological lens is
   adopted to pursue the proof-of-concept's development. From an
   operational perspective, a synthesis of literature using interpretivism
   provides the foundation for deductive research inquiry implemented
   within a case study approach. Within the case study, participatory
   action research (PAR) is implemented to test the proof of concept via
   three ``waterfall{''} research phases, namely, literature diagnosis and
   BIM package selection, BDO development and validation and evaluation.
   Findings
   The findings illustrate that a BDO (which represents the digital twin of
   manufacturing products) can augment and drive automation processes and
   workflows for construction product manufacturers within a contractor's
   supply chain. The developed framework illustrates the benefits of a BDO,
   by reducing the number of manufacturing processes to effectively
   eliminate early errors in the model, generates financial savings and
   reduces material wastage.
   Originality/value
   This research provides a seminal case study that implements BDO to
   automate construction product manufacturing processes and demonstrates
   the utilisation of BDO at an operational (vis-a-vis theoretical) level.
   Future research is proposed to implement a longitudinal approach to
   measure and report upon the success (or otherwise) of the proof of
   concept when implemented on fabrications and shop floor procedures.},

Abstract = {Innovation and digitalization are outstanding topics acquiring each day
   more importance for local governments, especially in Facility Management
   sector. Moreover, during the COVID-19 situation, new management needs
   emerged, especially in large public buildings. Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) is considered as one of the emerging technologies used to
   reach a total digitalization of the infrastructure. Nevertheless, BIM
   implementation carries important barriers with itself like, high
   software and hardware investments, initial BIM skills training or low
   data interoperability. The objective of this project is to overpass
   those implementation barriers. For this purpose, the paper shows the
   creation of a BIM-based intelligent platform for infrastructure
   management that leads to the development of a Digital Twin (DT). To show
   the potential of the software developed, a real implementation in the
   Civil Engineering School at Universidad Polite<acute accent>cnica de
   Madrid was carried out, obtaining significant results thanks to the
   actual feedback of infrastructure users and managers. The novelty of
   this project relies on the final results achieved, obtaining a complete
   DT for management functionalities like space reservation, live sensors
   data or assets management. All of it, linking BIM models with own
   software and hardware development using Internet of Things and cloud
   computing. A multidisciplinary work is compiled in this paper, providing
   the reader with the most relevant challenges detected in a real
   digitalization process.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Large underground spaces are complex and huge, with problems such as
   fragmented data that cannot be shared, outdated management methods, and
   high operation and maintenance costs. The digitization of building
   information and the use of digital twin technology can effectively
   improve the efficiency of building operation and maintenance. Using
   information technology to build a digital-twin-based operation and
   maintenance management system, the huge and discrete data and equipment
   system information are effectively integrated and explored for
   application. First, we analyze the shortcomings of the traditional
   delivery and operation and maintenance methods and introduce the
   necessity of a new method of operation and maintenance management based
   on digital twin; then, we divide the operation and maintenance
   information of the construction project into four major categories of
   spatial information and eight major categories of equipment information
   and complete the coding work, and the categorized data serve as the data
   basis for operation and maintenance; second, we develop a digital twin
   operation and maintenance management platform based on the operation and
   maintenance data of BIM; finally, we carry out case validation for the
   three major constructions. Finally, case validation is carried out for
   three major buildings and a large underground space and the practical
   application shows that the operation and maintenance management system
   based on digital twin technology provides technical guarantee for
   decentralized information and system integration management and the
   information management quality and efficiency of the operation and
   maintenance process are effectively improved. Through the practice of
   summarizing the experience, which is worth learning, we aim to create a
   large underground space operation and maintenance management method to
   provide a reference.},

Title = {Digital Trio: Integration of BIM-EIR-IoT for Facilities Management of
   Mega Construction Projects},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Facility Management (FM) has increasingly focused on integrating
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) with the Internet of Things (IoT),
   known as digital twins, in large-scale development projects. Effective
   BIM integration in FM requires improved cooperation among participants
   across various project stages. This digital revolution aims to enhance
   planning, construction, and asset management efficiency, benefiting all
   parties. However, BIM utilization in FM is limited by incomplete owner
   understanding, insufficient data accessibility, and stakeholders'
   unfamiliarity with BIM procedures and standards. Despite recognizing
   BIM's significance, the FM industry faces significant implementation
   challenges. Facility managers often lack a comprehensive understanding
   of BIM's benefits in streamlining operations and enhancing cost
   efficiency, as well as the necessary skills for its use. Addressing
   these barriers requires developing an Employer's Information
   Requirements (EIR) document at a project's outset, providing a strategic
   plan and vision for all involved parties. BIM and IoT are pivotal
   technologies for transitioning to efficient building operations and
   crucial for reducing time, costs, and operational challenges throughout
   any project. This research aims to establish a digital trio workflow,
   integrating BIM, EIR, and IoT to maximize stakeholder benefits. It
   explores how preparing the EIR through stakeholder communication can
   improve design processes, sustainability, efficiency, cost, and time,
   especially for megaprojects.},

Title = {A New Approach to 3D Facilities Management in Buildings Using GIS and
   BIM Integration: A Case Study Application},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This research seeks to advance the technological process of 3D
   digitization in built environments and streamline management processes
   in the construction sector through digital methodologies. To this end,
   an integration framework is proposed that combines geographic
   information systems (GISs) and building information modeling (BIM)
   digital models, specifically for simulating building facilities
   maintenance management. Although the proposed methodology is applicable
   across various geographical contexts and building typologies, to ensure
   clarity in its development, it was applied to a specific case study. For
   this purpose, a 3D GIS model was created for one of the campuses of the
   University of Cantabria in Santander, Spain, along with a BIM model for
   one of its university buildings. Using these integrated models, facility
   management was simulated within a 3D environment via a computerized
   maintenance management system (CMMS). The findings indicated that GIS
   and BIM digital models could indeed be integrated through
   straightforward linking mechanisms without compromising the efficiency
   of information synchronization and management. When comparing 2D
   facility management approaches with 3D formats, the advantages of 3D
   visualization became clear. This three-dimensional representation
   allowed for a more intuitive understanding of spatial dynamics and
   interactions, facilitating quicker identification of potential issues
   and more efficient maintenance operations. Consequently, integrating
   these advanced digital models not only optimizes operational efficiency
   but also fosters a collaborative environment, fundamentally transforming
   building facilities management.},

Abstract = {With the development of information technologies for industrial plants,
   more and more tools for digital design, creation and operation of
   industrial facilities are emerged. In particular, significant success in
   development of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Digital Twin
   technologies (DT) should be noted, which act as tools for digital
   transformation and representation for construction and production
   technologies respectively. In this regard, in this article, the
   principles and methods of integrating BIM and DT technologies within the
   framework of the so-called ``Factories of the Future{''} (FoF) are
   formulated. Wherein the physical twin of FoF includes both production
   technologies and production infrastructure with buildings, structures
   and systems included in it, while particular attention is given to
   Operation and Maintenances (O\&M) stage of object lifecycle which is
   less developed in comparison with design and creation stages. In
   addition, this paper also considers the role of systems information
   modeling (SIM) in such objects. Moreover, the concept of ``digital
   asset{''}, closely related to the FoF, is examined and semantically
   analyzed, especially from information ownership point of view. The
   features of convergence of BIM and DT technologies are analyzed, and the
   levels of development of these technologies are compared. Finally, the
   directions of further research in this interdisciplinary branch of
   researches and development are formulated.},

Abstract = {The current industrial facility market necessitates the digitization of
   both production and infrastructure to ensure compatibility. This
   digitization is presently accomplished using Building Information
   Modeling and digital twin technologies, as well as their integrated
   usage, which enhances convergence and adds further value to facility
   assets. However, these technologies primarily focus on the physical
   components of industrial facilities, neglecting processes, requirements,
   and functions. To address these gaps, the inclusion of the Model-Based
   System Engineering approach, a proven benchmark in systems engineering,
   is essential. This inclusion is the main objective of this research.
   This article outlines methods and principles for integrating Model-Based
   System Engineering into the informational modeling of existing
   industrial facilities to address current market gaps. It offers
   practical steps for such integration and compares it to other methods,
   positioning Model-Based System Engineering as a pivotal tool for
   enhancing the value of industrial facility digital assets. The main

   encompassing design, building, operation, and maintenance. The physical
   things are linked to cyberspace via SSIoT technology, significantly
   improving data exchange and processing capabilities. To address the
   limitations of singular monitoring technology, a BIM collaborative
   multi-source data monitoring method for residential engineering quality
   is proposed, utilizing the BIM model alongside the advancement of
   real-time transmitting monitoring LiDAR, automated monitoring robots,
   GNSS, and various other sensors. This framework seeks to create a novel
   paradigm for intelligent, comprehensive data management and synthesizing
   heterogeneous data from several sources, focusing on the quality
   monitoring of residential projects to guarantee quality, safety, and
   operational efficiency.},

Title = {A FRAMEWORK OF ATTRIBUTES FOR AS-BUILT BIM MODELS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {612-634},
Abstract = {Accurate digital twins are crucial in improving facility management.
   However, facility owners often encounter inaccurate digital twins due to
   incorrect as-built Building Information Modeling (BIM) models. By
   understanding the attributes of correct as-built BIM models, it is
   possible to reduce the production of inaccurate digital twins. This
   study aims to establish a framework of attributes for developing
   as-built BIM models. To achieve this, a systematic review of published
   articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) technique was conducted to identify relevant
   attributes for developing as-built BIM models. Next, a comprehensive
   conceptual framework was established for the development of as-built BIM
   models. Through the analysis of 50 articles, nine attributes of as-built
   BIM models were identified and grouped into three categories: data
   quality, data interoperability, and data security. Data quality
   encompasses accuracy, completeness, ease of understanding, coordination,
   consistency, and up-to-date. Data interoperability includes
   accessibility and compatibility, and data security pertains to security.
   The study findings could provide valuable guidance to industry
   practitioners and policymakers in developing strategies for producing
   correct as-built BIM models, ultimately improving the production of
   accurate digital twins and enhancing overall facility management.},

Title = {Study on city digital twin technologies for sustainable smart city
   design: A review and bibliometric analysis of geographic information
   system and building information modeling integration},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Geographic information system (GIS) data provide geospatial data on
   cities and spatial analysis functions that are essential for urban
   design. Building information modeling (BIM) includes a digital entity of
   construction, a passive presentation of micro-digital information on
   real entities, and an active application of models in the entire life
   cycle realization of the architecture, engineering, and construction
   industries. A combination of these technologies could provide a core
   technology for the urban digital twin to support sustainable smart city
   design. Through an insightful literature review, this paper summarizes
   the different disciplinary classifications of GIS and BIM functional
   integration, distills the value of data, and discusses the
   ontology-based data integration approach that GIS and BIM should take in
   the future to conduct research on integration applications in smart
   cities. To verify this view, keyword analysis, co-country analysis, and
   co-citation and coupling analyses are conducted using CiteSpace. GIS and
   BIM integration has attracted much attention. However, a professional
   disconnect and fragmented composition pose challenges in the field of
   GIS and BIM integration. Future research should focus on smart city
   planning, updating, management; ontology-based GIS and BIM data
   integration platform; and operation; and the collaborative management of
   urban rail transportation engineering.},

Abstract = {This paper delves into the integration of Factories of the Future (FoF)
   and digital twin technologies within urban contexts, marking a
   significant leap in Smart Cities development. We present a thorough
   exploration of the principles and a scientifically grounded framework
   designed for seamlessly blending advanced manufacturing systems with the
   urban environment's digital and physical aspects. Our detailed analysis
   has identified core principles crucial for this integration, focusing on
   interoperability, sustainability, adaptability, stakeholder

   framework that puts these principles into action, outlining strategic
   routes for incorporating digital twin and Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) technologies into FoF, establishing public-private partnerships,
   enhancing education and workforce development, and setting up mechanisms
   for ongoing evaluation and enhancement. The potential of this
   integration to transform urban development is vast, providing a model
   for boosting operational efficiency, driving economic growth, and
   enhancing urban livability. Although challenges exist in realizing this
   vision, our research offers practical insights and strategies for cities

Title = {Modeling indoor thermal comfort in buildings using digital twin and
   machine learning},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) concept is used in different domains and industries,
   including the building industry, as it has physical and digital assets
   with the help of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Technologies and
   methodologies constantly enrich the building industry because the amount
   of data generated during different building stages is considerable and
   has a tremendous effect on the lifecycle of a building. Previous
   research underscores the importance of seamlessly exchanging information
   between physical and digital assets within a comprehensive framework,
   particularly emphasizing the integration of BIM data with various
   systems to enhance efficiency and prevent information loss. Despite
   advancements in technologies, challenges persist in optimizing methods
   for integrating BIM data into DT frameworks, including ensuring
   interoperability, scalability, and real-time monitor and control. This
   study addresses this research gap by proposing a comprehensive platform
   that integrates the DT concept with IoT and BIM technologies. The
   platform is developed in five main stages: 1) acquiring electronic data
   of the building from the laser scanner, 2) developing a Wi-Fi IoT module
   and BIM data for physical assets and digital replica, 3) constructing
   the DT elements of the platform, 4) performing data analysis 5)
   implementing thermal comfort prediction models. Two machine learning
   models (Facebook prophet, NeuralProphet) are implemented to predict
   thermal comfort. The best predictive model is identified by evaluating
   its error function using historical training data collected during
   facility operation. A case study demonstrates the practical application
   of the proposed framework. The case study involves a real building where
   the platform is implemented to monitor and control indoor environments.
   By utilizing predefined data in BIM models, the platform ensures data
   accuracy, consistency, and usability. The case outputs reveal that
   Neuralprophet provides good prediction results.},

Title = {Digital Twin Research in the AECO-FM Industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {40},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine and discuss the current
   patterns, gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the architectural,
   engineering, construction, operation, and facility management (AECO-FM)
   industry and to propose future directions for industry stakeholders. A
   bibliometric search was performed on 197 papers that were obtained from
   the Scopus database. 151 of those papers were used in the subsequent
   scientometric analysis and mapping to narrate the evolution of the
   research subject. The studies discussed in the paper cover a wide range
   of research from model-based information management to building
   information management, all the way to the interaction between buildings
   and smart cities. The `virtual-physical building integration', `building
   lifecycle management', and `information integrated production' subjects
   are highly in the focus of the research field. While `information-based
   predictive management' and `virtual-based information utilization'
   studies need to be addressed for a holistic Digital Twin adoption in the
   AECO-FM industry. Future studies should focus on the full integration of
   digital twin and its physical counterpart for better performance
   throughout the building life cycle. This study highlights the patterns,
   gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the AECO-FM industry and
   contributes to the state-of-the-art digitalization and automation
   approaches in the construction project management body of knowledge. The
   sample size is a limitation for this research since it is relatively
   small due to the newness of the subject. Future studies may include data
   related to practice-oriented innovations and industry-initiated
   improvements to achieve broader and more informed results.},

   technologies to revamp building operation and maintenance processes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Globally, the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) industry has
   seen a rise in the adoption of digital twin (DT) technologies due to
   their potential to enhance collaboration and information communication
   throughout the project lifecycle from the design to operation and
   maintenance (O \& M) phase. However, empirical evidence on such adoption
   is fragmented, particularly for facility management (FM) activities
   during the O \& M phase. Considering this gap, an illustrative case
   study approach is performed to analyze and compare the traditional
   practices of FM with DT-driven FM during the O \& M phase using four
   geospatially representative cases. The findings show that DT
   technologies enable efficient and responsive planning and control of FM
   activities by providing real-time status of the building assets.
   However, barriers such as the misalignment of the data integration and
   data standards hamper their future implementation. To address this, a
   bottom-up conceptual framework is proposed to facilitate a wider
   implementation of DT technologies and support FM during the O \& M phase
   of buildings. As such, this paper's contribution is twofold: (1) it
   provides an aggregate landscape of DT application to manage facilities
   during the O \& M phase, and (2) it develops an evidence-induced
   conceptual framework for stakeholders who are grappling with their FM
   decision-making processes.},

   based on automatic fault detection and diagnostics},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {261},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The building industry consumes the most energy globally, making it a
   priority in energy efficiency initiatives. Heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning (HVAC) systems create the heart of buildings. Stable air
   handling unit (AHU) functioning is vital to ensuring high efficiency and
   extending the life of HVAC systems. This research proposes a Digital
   Twin predictive maintenance framework of AHU to overcome the limitations
   of facility maintenance management (FMM) systems now in use in
   buildings. Digital Twin technology, which is still at an initial stage
   in the facility management industry, use Building Information Modeling
   (BIM), Internet of things (IoT) and semantic technologies to create a
   better maintenance strategy for building facilities. Three modules are
   implemented to perform a predictive maintenance framework: operating
   fault detection in AHU based on the APAR (Air Handling Unit Performance
   Assessment Rules) method, condition prediction using machine learning
   techniques, and maintenance planning. Furthermore, the proposed
   framework was tested in a real-world case study with data between August
   2019 and October 2021 for an educational building in Norway to validate
   that the method was feasible. Inspection information and previous
   maintenance records are also obtained through the FM system. The results
   demonstrate that the continually updated data combined with APAR and
   machine learning algorithms can detect faults and predict the future
   state of Air Handling Unit (AHU) components, which may assist in
   maintenance scheduling. Removing the detected operating faults resulted
   in annual energy savings of several thousand dollars due to eliminating
   the identified operating faults. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {Semantics-based connectivity graph for indoor pathfinding powered by
   IFC-Graph},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {171},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Pathfinding is important for many indoor location-based applications
   such as facility management and indoor navigation. Conventional
   approaches for constructing indoor networks for pathfinding are mostly
   based on geometry processing, which can be computing-intensive and
   time-consuming, especially for buildings with complex irregular shapes.
   In addition, the generated geometric networks often lack semantics. This
   paper proposes a new semantics-based approach for constructing navigable
   indoor networks. This approach uses the rich semantic information from
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) in the form of IFC-Graph (i.e., a
   graph-based representation of building information developed in a prior
   study) so as to meet the needs of indoor pathfinding. Real-world
   building models are used to validate the proposed approach. The results
   show that 1) the semantics-based approach has advantages in
   object-to-object pathfinding such as space-to-space, space-to-exit, and
   space-to-facility, 2) the use of graph technology makes it flexible to
   add semantic information to the network to better support pathfinding
   applications. The semantics-based approach can fit into digital twin
   technology and integrate with augmented reality.},

Title = {IoT Open-Source Architecture for the Maintenance of Building Facilities},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the construction
   industry is evolving facility maintenance (FM) towards predictive
   maintenance development. Predictive maintenance of building facilities
   requires continuously updated data on construction components to be
   acquired through integrated sensors. The main challenges in developing
   predictive maintenance tools for building facilities is IoT integration,
   IoT data visualization on the building 3D model and implementation of
   maintenance management system on the IoT and building information
   modeling (BIM). The current 3D building models do not fully interact
   with IoT building facilities data. Data integration in BIM is
   challenging. The research aims to integrate IoT alert systems with BIM
   models to monitor building facilities during the operational phase and
   to visualize building facilities' conditions virtually. To provide
   efficient maintenance services for building facilities this research
   proposes an integration of a digital framework based on IoT and BIM
   platforms. Sensors applied in the building systems and IoT technology on
   a cloud platform with opensource tools and standards enable monitoring
   of real-time operation and detecting of different kinds of faults in
   case of malfunction or failure, therefore sending alerts to facility
   managers and operators. Proposed preventive maintenance methodology
   applied on a proof-of-concept heating, ventilation and air conditioning
   (HVAC) plant adopts open source IoT sensor networks. The results show
   that the integrated IoT and BIM dashboard framework and implemented
   building structures preventive maintenance methodology are applicable
   and promising. The automated system architecture of building facilities
   is intended to provide a reliable and practical tool for real-time data
   acquisition. Analysis and 3D visualization to support intelligent
   monitoring of the indoor condition in buildings will enable the facility
   managers to make faster and better decisions and to improve building
   facilities' real time monitoring with fallouts on the maintenance
   timeliness.},

Title = {Improving building occupant comfort through a digital twin approach: A
   Bayesian network model and predictive maintenance method},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {288},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {This study introduces a Bayesian network model to evaluate the comfort
   levels of occupants of two nonresidential Norwegian buildings based on
   data collected from satisfaction surveys and building performance
   parameters. A Digital Twin approach is proposed to integrate building
   information modeling (BIM) with real-time sensor data, occupant
   feedback, and a probabilistic model of occupant comfort to detect and
   predict HVAC issues that may impact comfort. The study also uses 200000
   points as historical data of various sensors to understand the previous
   building systems' behavior. The study also presents new methods for
   using BIM as a visualization platform and for predictive maintenance to
   identify and address problems in the HVAC system. For predictive
   maintenance, nine machine learning algorithms were evaluated using
   metrics such as ROC, accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, where
   Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) was the best algorithm for prediction.
   XGB is on average 2.5\% more accurate than Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
   and up to 5\% more accurate than the other models. Random Forest is
   around 96\% faster than XGBoost while being relatively easier to
   implement. The paper introduces a novel method that utilizes several
   standards to determine the remaining useful life of HVAC, leading to a
   potential increase in its lifetime by at least 10\% and resulting in
   significant cost savings. The result shows that the most important
   factors that affect occupant comfort are poor air quality, lack of
   natural light, and uncomfortable temperature. To address the challenge
   of applying these methods to a wide range of buildings, the study
   proposes a framework using ontology graphs to integrate data from
   different systems, including FM, CMMS, BMS, and BIM. This study's
   results provide insight into the factors that influence occupant
   comfort, help to expedite identifying equipment malfunctions and point
   towards potential solutions, leading to more sustainable and
   energy-efficient buildings. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {CityGML (City Geography Markup Language) is the most investigated
   standard in the integration of building information modeling (BIM) and
   the geographic information system (GIS), and it is essential for digital
   twin and smart city applications. The new CityGML 3.0 has been released
   for a while, but it is still not clear whether its new features bring
   new challenges or opportunities to this research topic. Therefore, the
   aim of this study is to understand the state of the art of CityGML in
   BIM/GIS integration and to investigate the potential influence of
   CityGML3.0 on BIM/GIS integration. To achieve this aim, this study used
   a systematic literature review approach. In total, 136 papers from Web
   of Science (WoS) and Scopus were collected, reviewed, and analyzed. The
   main findings of this review are as follows: (1) There are several
   challenging problems in the IFC-to-CityGML conversion, including LoD
   (Level of Detail) mapping, solid-to-surface conversion, and semantic
   mapping. (2) The `space' concept and the new LoD concept in CityGML 3.0
   can bring new opportunities to LoD mapping and solid-to-surface
   conversion. (3) The Versioning module and the Dynamizer module can add
   dynamic semantics to the CityGML. (4) Graph techniques and scan-to-BIM
   offer new perspectives for facilitating the use of CityGML in BIM/GIS
   integration. These findings can further facilitate theoretical studies
   on BIM/GIS integration.},

Journal = {ARCHIVES OF CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {347-363},
Abstract = {For several years, there has been an intensification of using BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) technology in the design and
   construction phases of building projects. However, it is rare to come
   across data regarding the implementation and subsequent verification of
   the utilization of BIM's capabilities in the longest phase of a
   building's life cycle - the operational phase. Currently, various
   property management systems and methods are applied during the
   operational phase of volumetric construction. However, these are often
   systems dedicated to specific types of activities (e.g., invoicing,
   electronic documentation approval), often requiring a significant amount
   of manual work. Additionally, current practices do not integrate the
   systems in use, and manual processing results in the manager receiving
   scattered and unformatted data that is difficult to use in daily
   operations. The aim of this article is to present the potential benefits
   of implementing BIM technology during the operational phase of a
   facility. The article outlines the possibilities of using the
   information introduced into the BIM model during the operational phase
   of a building. It also presents a proposed approach for creating a BIM
   model for the operational phase. In a subsequent article, the authors
   will focus on presenting an example of its implementation.},

Abstract = {The construction industry lacks a comprehensive and holistic way of
   utilizing Building Information Modeling (BIM) throughout a building's
   life-cycle, where the transition to Asset Management (AM) and Facility
   Management (FM) is particularly lacking. Enterprise BIM (EBIM) is an
   emerging, unexplored, holistic organizational concept that is designed
   to support and optimize business management throughout the entire
   life-cycles of buildings and infrastructure. However, current
   understanding and implementation of EBIM is rare. To fix this gap in
   knowledge, this paper defines the EBIM concept and assesses associated
   perspectives from research and practice in order to integrate BIM more
   strongly into the enterprise's core processes and other needs at
   different levels within the organization and externally. To achieve a
   higher and more efficient utilization of building data, however, EBIMs
   need to develop a clear life-cycle-based information management
   strategy, including coordination and communication between all
   stakeholders. The paper highlights and discusses the importance of both
   available and missing standards related to the effective implementation
   of EBIM. Several existing open standards have been identified to help
   strengthen the EBIM concept. The paper identifies a need to develop
   standards to integrate BIM and IoT (the Internet of Things) and
   standards that can handle both structured and unstructured data. The
   authors have conducted a wide-ranging review of research, practice and
   existing standards and considers today's potential for using EBIM, as
   well as discusses existing challenges and future research needs.
   Furthermore, the EBIM concept is contextualized by providing a case
   study with focus on cleaning. This study identifies a need to develop
   best practices in interdisciplinary collaborative projects. Such
   practical implementation requires integrated and standardized
   information and technology management and the exploitation of the
   available technologies in interdisciplinary interaction with those
   involved in the various processes and the flow of information throughout
   the life-cycle.},

   Systematic Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Intelligence in Industry 4.0 has led to the development of smart
   buildings with various control systems for data collection, efficient
   optimization, and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). However,
   buildings, especially with regard to heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning (HVAC) systems, are responsible for significant global
   energy consumption. Digital Twin (DT) technology offers a sustainable
   solution for facility management. This study comprehensively reviews DT
   performance evaluation in building life cycle and predictive
   maintenance. 200 relevant papers were selected using a systematic
   methodology from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, and various
   FDD methods were reviewed to identify their advantages and limitations.
   In conclusion, data-driven methods are gaining popularity due to their
   ability to handle large amounts of data and improve accuracy,
   flexibility, and adaptability. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning
   as data-driven methods are important for FDD in building operations,
   such as with HVAC systems, as they can handle unlabeled data and
   identify complex patterns and anomalies. Future studies should focus on
   developing interpretable models to understand how the models made their
   predictions. Hybrid methods that combine different approaches show
   promise as reliable methods for further research. Additionally, deep
   learning methods can analyze large and complex datasets, indicating a
   promising area for further investigation.},

Abstract = {3D virtual management is a topic of growing interest. The AEC industry
   is undergoing a real revolution because of the technological changes
   that are taking place. Synchronized 3D visualization is one of the tools
   being deployed at an accelerated pace. This, together with collaborative
   work, contributes to optimal management for all stakeholders. The
   integration of geographic information systems and building information
   modeling and heritage BIM is one of the most innovative concepts; it
   enables the generation of collaborative, fluid systems. The objective of
   this research is to identify the most significant technological
   developments and potential applications of the aforementioned
   integration. For this purpose, after a bibliographic consultation
   (26,245 sources), two analyses are carried out (from the screening of
   179 sources), one quantitative (bibliometric) and the other qualitative
   (focused on five key concepts). The results show that regarding the
   integration of GIS with BIM and HBIM, the highest concentration of
   contributions is in engineering with 30.66\%, followed by computer
   science with 21.01\%. The country with the highest number of citations
   is China with 717, followed by Australia and the USA with 549 and 513,
   respectively, but relativizing the number of citations based on various
   indices (human development index, gross national income per capita, and
   population-tertiary education level), Hong Kong (18.04), Australia
   (10.64), and Egypt (10.16) would take the top positions, respectively.
   Regarding universities, the entity that has generated the most
   references is Delft University of Technology (the Netherlands) with 15
   papers, followed by University College London (UK) with 13. Finally, the
   results show that GIS and BIM and HBIM provide virtual 3D models with
   multiple applications for buildings and infrastructures.},

Title = {EXPLORING THE ENTERPRISE BIM CONCEPT IN PRACTICE: THE CASE OF ASSET
   MANAGEMENT IN A NORWEGIAN HOSPITAL},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {Organizations face challenges in utilizing Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) for digital Asset Management (AM), as BIM from the design and
   construction phases often proves to be of limited use for AM. To address
   this, the concept of Enterprise BIM is introduced with the aim of
   organizing BIM activities throughout the lifecycle in line with the
   organization's operational and strategic needs. The article explores the
   current industry practices of implementing Enterprise BIM for effective
   AM support. It focuses on Vestfold Health Trust and its award-winning
   hospital project in Toensberg, Norway, which was notable for its use of
   Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) and its attempts to adopt Enterprise
   BIM methodologies and solutions. Through literature studies and
   interviews with fifteen key personnel, the article provides
   recommendations for significant improvement within ontological
   adaptation, and associated IT solutions needs. The results highlight the
   limitations of using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema and
   format for AM applications and suggest the development of flexible,
   searchable solutions based on ontologies and semantics to integrate
   sensor data into digital twins and asset information models. The study
   reveals a competency gap and deficiencies in information processes and
   IT solutions that organizations, along with the industry, must both
   address, emphasizing the use of international standards such as ISO
   19650 to improve the integration of value chain considerations. Overall,
   this article provides valuable recommendations and a roadmap for the
   more strategic, holistic, and sustainable management of building
   information that aims to take into account and satisfy the end-user's
   information needs.},

Abstract = {The integration of the building information modelling (BIM) and assets
   database has enabled a potential pathway for building stakeholders to
   add value to the building lifecycle management (BLM) processes. However,
   the obtaining, storing, processing, and distributing of data have not
   been ratified in a detailed and semantic manner in any official
   guideline. This paper suggests a framework for the efficient development
   of an interoperable visualisation of a building ``digital twin{''}
   through an intuitive interface, to contribute to the idea above. The
   framework was applied in two case studies as examples, where rich
   visualisations of two buildings in the Kanta-flame region of Finland
   were constructed using their architectural models and building indoor
   climate metrics. By constructing an engaging interface, relevant metrics
   and constant feedback from buildings' occupants are gathered, meaningful
   data is selected, processed, and displayed to improve the facility
   management (FM) process. The yielded result is a progressive web
   application (PWA), where valuable sets of building performance data are
   visualised and a promptly communicable channel between owners/occupants
   and building system is delivered. Further development of this
   application in practice and research work is also proposed to harness
   the data-driven monitoring and automation in buildings to the greatest
   extent.},

Abstract = {Effective asset management in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction/facilities management (AEC/FM) industry is crucial for
   improving asset performance and lifespan, as well as reducing downtimes
   and maintenance costs. Current asset management practices mostly rely on
   outdated paper-based approaches that are prone to data loss, security
   attacks, and missing information. Emerging technologies, such as digital
   twins, are being proposed to solve existing asset management problems in
   the AEC industry. However, the industry perspective is often missing in
   the evaluation of such technology-led approaches regarding actual
   applications and implementation challenges. This study seeks to
   understand the potential of digital twins in solving current asset
   management issues and challenges within the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
   context. To achieve this aim, structured interviews were conducted with
   14 industry experts to capture their understanding of current digital
   technologies and existing issues in asset management. The findings of
   this study underscore the transformative potential of digital twins as a
   tool for optimizing asset performance and decision-making throughout the

   Strategies: A Systematic Literature Review Focusing on Daylight and

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the architecture, engineering, and construction industries, the
   integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become
   instrumental in shaping the design and commissioning of smart buildings.
   At the center of this development is the pursuit of more intelligent,
   efficient, and sustainable built environments. The emergence of smart
   buildings equipped with advanced sensor networks and automation systems
   increasingly requires the implementation of Digital Twins (DT) for the
   direct coupling of BIM methods for integral building planning,
   commissioning, and operational monitoring. While simulation tools and
   methods exist in the design phase of developing advanced controls, their
   mapping to construction or post-construction models is less well
   developed. Through systematic, keyword-based literature research on
   publisher-independent databases, this review paper gives a comprehensive
   overview of the state of the research on BIM integration of building
   control systems with a primary focus on combined controls for daylight
   and artificial lighting systems. The review, supported by a bibliometric
   literature analysis, highlights major development fields in HVAC
   controls, failure detection, and fire-detection systems, while the
   integration of daylight and artificial lighting controls in Digital
   Twins is still at an early stage of development. In addition to already
   existing reviews in the context of BIM and Digital planning methods,
   this review particularly intends to build the necessary knowledge base
   to further motivate research activities to integrate simulation-based
   control methods in the BIM planning process and to further close the gap
   between planning, implementation, and commissioning.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the architecture, engineering, construction, and
   facility management (FM) industries have been applying various emerging
   digital technologies to facilitate the design, construction, and
   management of infrastructure facilities. Digital twin (DT) has emerged
   as a solution for enabling real-time data acquisition, transfer,
   analysis, and utilization for improved decision-making toward smart FM.
   Substantial research on DT for FM has been undertaken in the past
   decade. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the literature on
   DT for FM. A total of 248 research articles are obtained from the Scopus
   and Web of Science databases. VOSviewer is then utilized to conduct
   bibliometric analysis and visualize keyword cooccurrence, citation, and
   co-authorship networks; furthermore, the research topics, authors,
   sources, and countries contributing to the use of DT for FM are
   identified. The findings show that the current research of DT in FM
   focuses on building information modeling-based FM, artificial
   intelligence (AI)-based predictive maintenance, real-time cyber-physical
   system data integration, and facility lifecycle asset management.
   Several areas, such as AI-based real-time asset prognostics and health
   management, virtual-based intelligent infrastructure monitoring, deep
   learning-aided continuous improvement of the FM systems, semantically
   rich data interoperability throughout the facility lifecycle, and
   autonomous control feedback, need to be further studied. This review
   contributes to the body of knowledge on digital transformation and smart
   FM by identifying the landscape, state-of-the-art research trends, and
   future needs with regard to DT in FM.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a next-generation smart
   building management solution, seamlessly bridging traditional Building
   Automation Systems (BAS) with Industry 4.0 innovations such as Building
   Information Modelling (BIM), artificial intelligence (AI), big data,
   Internet of Things (IoT), and Extended Reality (XR). However, current DT
   applications in building operations remain nascent, challenged by
   multi-source data integration, technology interoperability, and
   visualization interface development. This study proposes a fivelayer DT
   architecture integrating BIM, BAS, IoT, AI, and MR for 3D interactive
   building operations, implemented on a typical floor of a high-rise
   office building incorporating its central air conditioning system. The
   DT demonstrated both on-site and remote capabilities, including BIM
   visualization, mapping and navigation, indoor environment monitoring,
   portable HVAC system monitoring and control, and AI-empowered
   optimization. These capabilities represent significant advantages in
   terms of operation management, work efficiency, operator experience and
   response speed.},

Abstract = {Digitisation of the built environment is seen as a significant factor
   for innovation in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and
   Operation sector. However, lack of data and information in as-built
   digital models considerably limits the potential of Building Information
   Modelling in Facility Management. Therefore, optimisation of data
   collection and management is needed, all the more so now that Industry
   4.0 has widened the use of sensors into buildings and infrastructures. A
   literature review on the two main pillars of digitalisation in
   construction, Building Information Modelling and Internet of Things, is
   presented, along with a bibliographic analysis of two citations and
   abstracts databases focusing on the operations stage. The bibliographic
   research has been carried out using Web of Science and Scopus databases.
   The article is aimed at providing a detailed analysis of BIM-IoT
   integration for Facility Management (FM) process improvements. Issues,
   opportunities and areas where further research efforts are required are
   outlined. Finally, four key areas of further research development in FM
   management have been proposed, focusing on optimising data collection
   and management.},

   Models through Robot Process Automation},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The rapid evolution of digital technologies has revolutionized the
   architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, driving the
   wide-spread adoption of digital twins for structures. These virtual
   replicas, developed using Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   methodology, incorporate extensive information databases, proving
   indispensable for enhancing project management throughout a structure's
   entire lifecycle and towards smart city development. As the impact of
   climate change continues to grow, hazardous weather alerts play a
   critical role as an early-warning system that notifies stakeholders of
   imminent threats, thereby influencing decision-making processes in
   construction projects. Surprisingly, despite its evident value, the
   integration of alert systems for hazardous weather conditions into BIM
   is often overlooked. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Robot Process
   Automation (RPA) protocols to automate the integration of real-time
   weather parameters into a structure's BIM models. These very protocols
   are also used as alert systems, enabling the timely notification of
   stakeholders in the event of detected hazardous weather conditions. The
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through its
   practical application in enhancing the safety of an actual building in
   Vi \& ntilde;a del Mar, Chile.},

Abstract = {Facility Management (FM) regards the management of buildings' assets and
   requires the administration of a large amount of data that must always
   be available, but today, they still consist of paper documents, which
   are susceptible to loss. This is one of the principal causes for costs
   increase in the Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) phase, together with
   the lack of interoperability and communication. In recent years, the
   construction industry has been undergoing a process of digitalization,
   supported from the advent of new technologies that hit the market at low
   prices. This study aims to indagate the technologies introduced in in
   the FM sector, in addition the major authors and sources that are
   studying them. A bibliometric analysis is conducted on 220 documents
   belonging to the Scopus DB. The documents were analyzed using
   bibliometric analysis tools, such as Biblioshiny and VOSviewer. The
   results show how FM and the implementation of technologies in its
   practices, such as Building information modelling (BIM), Internet of
   Things (IoT) and Digital Twin (DT), are fields with exponential growth
   in recent years. Other technologies, such as blockchain, artificial

Abstract = {This study focuses on calibration and test campaigns of an IoT
   camera-based sensor system to monitor occupancy, as part of an ongoing
   research project aiming at defining a Building Management System (BMS)
   for facility management based on an occupancy-oriented Digital Twin
   (DT). The research project aims to facilitate the optimization of
   building operational stage through advanced monitoring techniques and
   data analytics. The quality of collected data, which are the input for
   analyses and simulations on the DT virtual entity, is critical to ensure
   the quality of the results. Therefore, calibration and test campaigns
   are essential to ensure data quality and efficiency of the IoT sensor
   system. The paper describes the general methodology for the BMS
   definition, and method and results of first stages of the research. The
   preliminary analyses included Indicative Post-Occupancy Evaluations
   (POEs) supported by Building Information Modelling (BIM) to optimize
   sensor system planning. Test campaign are then performed to evaluate
   collected data quality and system efficiency. The method was applied on
   a Department of Politecnico di Milano. The period of the year in which
   tests are performed was critical for lighting conditions. In addition,
   spaces' geometric features and user behavior caused major issues and
   faults in the system.Incorrect boundary definition: areas that are not

Title = {Digital twin with Machine learning for predictive monitoring of CO2
   equivalent from existing buildings},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {284},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The revolution of the industry 4.0 presents a new era of digital
   transformation for the construction indus-try, advancing towards the
   concept of digital twins, while on the other hand it faces the global
   challenge of reducing carbon emissions from operational assets. The
   current research gap in the application of dig-ital twins for achieving
   net zero were reviewed in this study, highlighting its potentials for
   enhancement in the built environment, and emphasizing the need for
   demonstration of a use-case analysis for its adop-tion by the industry.
   This research presents a digital twin solution to automate the
   monitoring and con-trolling of equivalent carbon dioxide (eCO2)
   emissions from existing assets through the integration of IoT, BIM, and
   artificial intelligence across a comprehensive solution, further
   validating its workability through a real-life use case analysis. The
   study revealed the significance of BIM and IoT, as essential components
   of a digital twin to visualise critical spatial information for enhanced
   facility management specifically for monitoring of indoor air quality of
   spaces, while also coalescing an AI-supported system to predict carbon
   emissions from the collected data through integration of machine
   learning features across the digital twin. The output of the entire
   solution is displayed as an interactive dashboard for observing trends
   and patterns, enabling stakeholders to implement effective data-driven
   retrofitting strategies. This research is a fundamental initiation for
   implementing digital twins to monitor emissions from existing assets, a
   step towards achieving the net zero targets.Crown Copyright (c) 2023

Abstract = {Facility management is an essential part of the building which
   encompasses multiple service areas and processes to ensuring optimum
   functionality of the facility. Digital twin (DT) has been increasingly
   introduced to the FM domain to facilitate FM tasks such as
   decision-making. Despite the advancements in DT-enabled FM, there still
   exists a problem in the disconnections between DT academics and FM
   practitioners. The emergence of knowledge management can act as a bridge
   between academics and FM practitioners. To mine knowledge in the
   DT-enabled FM industry for a better communication between different
   stakeholders and timely decisions in the case of emergency, this study
   proposes a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach. A detailed
   classification of FM-related entities is first presented, which divides
   the FM into five categories. The NLP model is used to extract entities
   and knowledge from a large volume of text data. The results indicate
   that an NLP-based approach can accurately extract FM-related knowledge.
   The findings of this study not only provide a basis for automatic
   DT-enabled FM-related knowledge extraction but also support the
   downstream tasks such as knowledge graph construction and FM-related
   emergency decision-making.},

Abstract = {The accurate assessment and effective management of deep excavation risk
   have faced longstanding challenges due to the highly complicated and
   uncertain construction process. A digital twin, designed with the
   datamechanism-fused (DMF) physical and virtual models, is developed to
   solve problems by integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM), data
   mining (DM), and physical mechanisms. In the DMF physical model, a
   mechanical model is embedded into the digital twin to implement
   real-time interaction and inversion between fieldmeasured and simulated
   data, thus revealing the evolution law of mechanical properties and
   creating a multisource DMF database. In the virtual model, the random
   forest (RF) regression is applied to fully learn the multisource
   database and accurately predict retaining wall behaviors on behalf of
   excavation risk. The proposed digital twin facilitates practical
   applications to imitate physical construction process, predict
   excavation-induced behavior, and realize closed-loop risk management
   with a high degree of automation, intelligence, and reliability.},

   Information Modeling-Systematic Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Predictive maintenance of built assets often relies on scheduled routine
   practices that are disconnected from real-time stress assessment,
   degradation and defects. However, while Digital Twin (DT) technology
   within building and urban studies is maturing rapidly, its use in
   predictive maintenance is limited. Traditional preventive and reactive
   maintenance strategies that are more prevalent in facility management
   are not intuitive, not resource efficient, cannot prevent failure and
   either underserve the asset or are surplus to requirements. City
   Information Modeling (CIM) refers to a federation of BIM models in
   accordance with real-world geospatial references, and it can be deployed
   as an Urban Digital Twin (UDT) at city level, like BIM's deployment at
   building level. This study presents a systematic review of 105
   Scopus-indexed papers to establish current trends, gaps and
   opportunities for a cognitive predictive maintenance framework in the
   architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry.
   A UDT framework consisting of the CIM of a section of the University of
   Florida campus is proposed to bridge the knowledge gap highlighted in
   the systematic review. The framework illustrates the potential for
   CNN-IoT integration to improve predictive maintenance through advance
   notifications. It also eliminates the use of centralized information
   archiving.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Current railway infrastructure maintenance work, which is mostly carried
   out by visual inspection, has a reactive approach, dissociated
   information, and limited follow-up. On the other hand, railway bridges,
   being critical infrastructures, require effective monitoring and
   maintenance to guarantee their safety and operation over time. The
   designed tool links a parametric BIM model in Revit (R) with an
   automated spreadsheet in MS Excel (R) through visual programming in
   Dynamo, generating BIM/data automation as an initial step towards a
   digital twin. This achieves a bidirectional flow to exchange data on the
   structural condition of elements. The procedure was applied to a railway
   bridge in use for over 100 years, representing its geometry and damage
   information according to technical standards. The value lies in laying
   the foundations for adopting preventive approaches for this key
   infrastructure. The BIM/data automation allows the BIM model to visually
   reflect the condition of the elements, depending on their damage,
   consolidate the inspection information, and generate a visual management
   tool. In conclusion, the designed BIM/data automation improves the
   monitoring of railway bridges compared to traditional methods,
   facilitating the interaction and relationship between the damage records
   and the actual bridge elements, laying the foundations for the
   construction of digital twins.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The provision of data with information management are a significant
   challenge for the digital developing construction industry. The
   utilisation of data from a built asset's planning, design, and
   construction phases to the operations phase core and to the facility
   management function of building and integration in supporting core
   business and support services is frequently limited due to technical
   obstacles in information management. The paper presents the second of
   three stages of design science research to propose a conceptual approach
   for the implementation of the ``as-a-service{''} method for the
   construction industry, namely ``Building-as-a-Service{''} (BaaS). BaaS
   involves a shift in the concept of services: users become recipients of
   services generated by the building, not only services provided in the
   building. The paper shows the interdependencies between these various
   concepts and suggests a possible framework for the inclusion of these
   ``as-a-Service{''} approaches for enabling a Digital Twin based on
   Building Information Modelling, which is becoming mandatory in several
   European states. The study gathered the foundational theoretical
   constructs through a literature review and elucidated them to make the
   proposed framework feasible. The theoretical foundations comprise
   Building Information Modelling (BIM), the Digital Twin (DT), the
   interconnecting technology of smart applications and the practical
   application in projects. The approach of ``Building-as-a-Service{''} in
   combination with smart applications can be an approach to making the use
   of buildings available in a resource-saving way to clients, building
   owners and users.},

Title = {Multi-domain ubiquitous digital twin model for information management of
   complex infrastructure systems},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {56},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Digital twin is a comprehensive digital equivalent of an object or an
   activity, reflecting the semantic and geometric properties and behaviors
   through virtual models and data. Digital twin and related information
   technologies are widely used in the construction, operation and
   maintenance of infrastructure and facility. Transdisciplinary
   stakeholders are always involved in the long-term and cross-scene
   management of IoT and digital twin-enabled smart infrastructures and
   facilities. The intensive interactions among stakeholders often cause
   conflicts due to the variations in experience, knowledge, and interests.
   Moreover, with the change propagation of digital twins, cyber-physical
   resources can't be efficiently and consistently established, connected,
   and utilized with multi-domain information through selective
   simplification and structured methods. This paper proposes a Ubiquitous
   Digital Twin model for the information management of complex
   infrastructure systems based on Domain-Driven Design. To achieve the
   unified and structured description, six domains are deployed in the
   proposed model with sequential or parallel tuples for shared
   understanding of overall system framework or specific functional
   modules. Three cases of one smart nuclear plant management scenario are
   hierarchically instantiated to evaluate the proposed model.},

Title = {Digital twin-enabled built environment sensing and monitoring through
   semantic enrichment of BIM with SensorML},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Effective environmental condition monitoring provides constant
   surveillance of the built environment and re-veals deteriorations that
   could impact the daily operation of facilities, especially amid COVID
   situations. However, the current Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data
   schema for Building Information Modelling (BIM) provided limited support
   to represent full semantics related to environmental sensing and
   monitoring. How to semantically enrich the IFC schema with enhanced data
   description capability for informed decision-making in smart facilities
   management (FM) amid COVID situations remains an open question. This
   paper develops a semi-automatic extension and integration of IFC data
   schema with Sensor Model Language (SensorML) specification in order to
   support automated built environment sensing and monitoring. Referring to
   SensorML, an extended IFC model view definition for a comprehensive
   description of required sensor metadata and sensing entities is
   presented. An Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network is then
   established to realise continuous data collection from a variety of
   wireless sensing devices. The spatial-temporal data captured by the IoT
   sensor network are extracted by a regular expression-based data
   distillation algorithm and integrated with the digital twin, in which
   spatial interpolation algorithms further analyse, compute, and visualise
   the state of the environment. The pro-posed method is demonstrated via
   an experimental study which supports real-time environmental monitoring
   and delivers more actionable insights to facility managers to sustain
   the daily operation of buildings. This study contributes new methods and
   models to semantically enrich the digital twin from the data perspective
   for environmental condition monitoring during the pandemic time which
   fosters the development of holistic building facility management.},

Title = {Prospects for digital twin technology in the building modular
   construction and operation phases: A game theory-based analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {470},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Modular construction and operation significantly impact building
   lifecycle management, with various stakeholders playing key roles.
   Digital twin technology emerges as a cutting-edge tool for information
   exchange, management, and forecasting in the construction sector,
   offering comprehensive services for diverse stakeholders. However,
   research primarily explores potential applications and practical
   solutions, with limited focus on application strategies considering all
   stakeholders' interests. This gap hinders the transition of digital twin
   technology from theoretical to practical use. Addressing this, the paper
   employs game theory to develop models that analyze key stakeholder
   decisions during the modular construction and operational phases. It
   creatively introduces mathematical models for complex conditions in the
   operation phase and conducts numerical simulations. Findings show that
   the diffusion rate of digital twin technology significantly affects
   decision-making by main stakeholders in the construction industries in
   two stages. The diffusion rate in other industries influences the
   decision of facility management contractors from different backgrounds,
   yet its implementation ultimately depends on their status and
   profitability during the operation process. These diffusion rates are
   influenced by various factors like government subsidies, development
   costs, and revenues. To enhance the application rate of digital twin
   technology, the paper suggests initiating pilot projects, creating
   project pools, expanding industryuniversity-research collaborations, and
   implementing subsidies and incentive programs.},

Title = {An ontology-based methodology to establish city information model of
   digital twin city by merging BIM, GIS and IoT},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {With the development of digital city and smart city construction, the
   City Information Model (CIM) has played a critical role as a container
   of spatial-temporal data to establish the Digital Twin City. For a
   digital twin city, a virtual high-fidelity CIM model that corresponds
   closely to the real physical world is the premise and cornerstone of its
   construction. Therefore, the integration of BIM, GIS and IoT has become
   the preferred topic for researchers and has received much more attention
   from a wide academic circle. However, traditional integration mainly
   focuses on the conversion of both IFC and CityGML, and IoT data are also
   often used as visualizations. More importantly, the underlying data
   formats of GIS, BIM and IoT are still independent of each other without
   a unified data structure expression, so real data-driven analysis and
   decision-making cannot be implemented. This study aims to establish a
   general CIM ontology to integrate heterogeneous BIM, GIS and IoT data.
   First, the related work of BIM, GIS and IoT integration is studied and
   analyzed. A comparison of three mainstream approaches, data conversion,
   standard extension and data linking, is conducted, and it illustrates
   the advantages of ontology techniques in solving data interoperability
   problems. Second, a technical framework of BIM, GIS and IoT data
   integration based on ontology technology is proposed. The approach is
   mainly divided into five steps: geometry processing, data instantiation,
   ontology construction, ontology mapping and querying application. On the
   basis of the CIM ontology, an application ontology is built for a
   specific application domain to illustrate rulebased mapping, querying
   and inferring. Finally, the case study shows that the Ontology-based
   methodology in this paper has contributed to establish a general pattern
   for CIM data integration by mapping and linking concepts from the
   semantic level. It avoids changes in the original data sources and the
   missing data problem.},

Title = {A TOOL-BASED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR A DIGITAL TWIN: A CASE STUDY IN A
   HEALTHCARE FACILITY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {107-137},
Abstract = {Changes in the local and global markets are forcing A/E/C/FM
   (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management)
   organizations to deliver more robust and innovative operational BIMs
   (Building Information Models). It is hypothesized that BIMs will
   transform from a static 3D model to a Digital Twin providing a truly
   digital representation of the physical asset or the building it
   represents. This transformation to a dynamic Digital Twin will allow the
   A/E/C/FM industry to visualize, monitor, and optimize operational assets
   and processes to support better inspection and analysis for a more
   efficient facility operations and maintenance. To support the adoption
   and implementation of Digital Twin in A/E/C/FM, the authors have defined
   two clear objectives. First, we discuss requirements for a
   functionality-based canonical architecture to create a digital twin
   followed by proposing two tool-based system architecture options for its
   implementation. Second, we use a case study approach to develop a
   proof-of-concept Digital Twin of an operating room in a healthcare
   facility using Power BI Desktop and Azure Services. The prototype aims
   to monitor room air quality as per INAIL (National Institute for
   Insurance against Accidents at Work) and ISO (International Organization
   for Standards) standards. Multiple sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi 4
   are used to capture real-time data for various air quality parameters
   including temperature, humidity, airflow, particulate contamination, and
   Nitrous Oxide (N2O) gas. Multiple dashboards are also created to
   visualize, monitor, and analyze the data harnessed from the OR sensors.
   The implementation addresses critical issues including security, data
   storage, visualization, processing, data streaming, collection, and
   analysis. As an initial validation, the Digital Twin prototype was
   presented and discussed with a healthcare BIM manager. Initial feedback
   from the industry expert indicated that the prototype could decrease the
   required time to respond to facility maintenance issues such as
   decreased air flow due to possible obstructions.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) are defined as capable of achieving some
   elements of cognition, notably memory (encoding and retrieval),
   perception (creating useful data representations), and reasoning
   (outlier and event detection). This paper presents the development of a
   CDT, populated by construction information, facility management data,
   and data streamed from the Building Automation System (BAS). Advanced
   machine learning was enabled by access to both real-time and historical
   data coupled with scalable cloud-based computational resources.
   Streaming data to the cloud has been implemented in existing
   architectures; to address security concerns from exposing building
   equipment to undesirable access, a secure streaming architecture from
   BACnet equipment to our research cloud is presented. Real-time data is
   uploaded to a high-performance scalable time-series database, while the
   ontology is stored on a relational database. Both data sources are
   integrated with Building Information Models (BIM) to aggregate, explore,
   and visualize information on demand. This paper presents a case study of
   a Digital Twin (DT) of an academic building where various capabilities
   of CDTs are demonstrated through a series of proof-of-concept examples.
   Drawing from our experience enhancing this implementation with elements
   of cognition, we present a development framework and reference
   architecture to guide future whole-building CDT research.},

Title = {A Novel Method for Tunnel Digital Twin Construction and Virtual-Real
   Fusion Application},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Tunnels play important roles in integrated transport infrastructure. A
   digital twin reproduces a real tunnel scene in virtual space and
   provides new means for tunnel digital maintenance. Aiming at the
   existing problems of video fragmentation, separation of video and
   business data, and lack of two- and three-dimensional linkage response
   methods in tunnel digital operation, in this paper, we propose a novel
   method for tunnel digital twin construction and virtual-real integration
   operation. Firstly, the digital management requirements of tunnel
   operations are systematically analyzed to clarify the purpose of digital
   twin construction. Secondly, BIM technology is used to construct a
   static model of the tunnel scene that conforms to the real tunnel main
   structure. Thirdly, a three-dimensional registration and projection
   calculation method is proposed to integrate tunnel surveillance video
   into a three-dimensional virtual scene in real time. Fourthly,
   multi-source sensing data are gathered and fused to form a digital twin
   scene that is basically the same as the real tunnel traffic operations
   scene. Finally, a management model suitable for digital twins is
   discussed to improve the efficiency of tunnel operations and management,
   and a tunnel in China is selected to verify this method. The results
   show that the proposed method is helpful to realize the application of
   two- and three-dimensional linkages of tunnel traffic smooth, accident
   rescue, facility management, and emergency response, and to improve the
   efficiency of tunnel digital management.},

Title = {An ontology-based innovative energy modeling framework for scalable and
   adaptable building digital twins},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {292},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Digitalization of buildings and the use of IoT sensing and metering
   devices are steadily increasing, offering new opportunities for more
   autonomous, efficient, and flexible buildings. As part of this
   transformation and inspired by the added value demonstrated in other
   domains, the concept of a building digital twin that can monitor,
   simulate, manage, and optimize building operation has received increased
   interest. To aid such digital twin implementations, accurate and
   adaptable simulation models are required, which can effectively
   integrate and utilize the available data. However, traditional building
   modeling and digital practices, such as Building Information Modeling
   and white-box modeling tools, are not easily compatible with these
   requirements. This work presents an innovative and flexible energy
   modeling framework based on the SAREF ontology. With a basis in the
   SAREF4BLDG extension for buildings and the defined classes, different
   models are presented for a selection of typical systems and devices such
   as spaces, space heaters, dampers, coils, etc. Using the generic
   semantics and relations of the SAREF4SYST extension, a method for
   linking and simulating component models is then presented. A
   proof-of-concept of the modeling framework is provided, showing its
   application and feasibility to provide a dynamic simulation of the
   different systems and devices included in a demonstration case. Finally,
   a future line of work is identified considering the implementation of
   the modeling framework in an actual building case study, including
   integration with actual sensing equipment to demonstrate different
   digital twin services such as performance monitoring, strategy planning,
   and operational optimization.},

Title = {Digital Twin Framework for Enabling Serial Construction},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Modularized construction with precast concrete elements has many
   advantages, such as shorter construction times, higher quality,
   flexibility, and lower costs. These advantages are mainly due to its
   potential for prefabrication and series production. However, the
   production processes are still craftsmanship, and automation rarely
   occurs. Fundamental to the automation of production is digitization. In
   recent years, the manufacturing industry made significant progress
   through the intelligent networking of components, machines, and
   processes in the introduction of Industry 4.0. A key concept of Industry
   4.0 is the digital twin, which represents both components and machines,
   thus creating a dynamic network in which the participants can
   communicate with each other. So far, BIM and digital twins in
   construction have focused mainly on the structure as a whole and do not
   consider feedback loops from production at the component level. This
   paper proposes a framework for a digital twin for the industrialized
   production of precast concrete elements in series production based on
   the asset administration shell (AAS) from the context of Industry 4.0.
   For this purpose, relevant production processes are identified, and
   their information requirements are derived. Data models and
   corresponding AAS for precast concrete parts will be created for the
   identified processes. The functionalities of the presented digital twin
   are demonstrated using the use case of quality control for a precast
   concrete wall element. The result shows how data can be exchanged with
   the digital twin and used for decision-making.},

Title = {Agile Construction Digital Twin Engineering},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Digital twins have attracted a lot of attention recently. However, the
   current manifestations are merely digital shadows, lacking means for
   bidirectional data exchange, which makes their use for assisting the
   construction of buildings much more difficult. We argue that this is due
   to the lack of a systematic process for developing a digital twin during
   a building's life cycle. We argue to look for a solution by combining
   agile engineering with IT change management to establish an agile,
   change-driven process for engineering digital twins. Such a process, of
   course, deserves a qualitative assessment of the engineering process and
   the resulting digital twin. In the future, it should be possible to
   obtain a digital twin from a BIM-based design process by applying IT
   change management in an agile manner. This should happen under maximum
   automation and life cycle orientation. Our proposal is motivated by
   several years of interdisciplinary collaboration between civil
   engineering and computer science and evaluated using the Technology
   Acceptance Model. While the TAM is not specifically designed for digital
   twin methodologies, its application here aims to assess perceived
   usefulness and ease of use of DT methodologies from the user's
   perspective, without addressing scalability concerns. This aims to
   provide actionable insights to guide the refinement of the process
   model, aligning it with user requirements and achieving its intended
   outcomes. Our evaluation confirms the proposed process's perceived
   usefulness and ease of use, with robust correlations indicating strong
   acceptance potential among stakeholders. These results highlight the
   feasibility of the proposed approach and its alignment with expectations
   in real-world applications.},

Volume = {24},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to introduce a new methodology for generating
   synthetic images for facility management purposes. The method starts by
   leveraging the existing 3D open-source BIM models and using them inside
   a graphic engine to produce a photorealistic representation of indoor
   spaces enriched with facility-related objects. The virtual environment
   creates several images by changing lighting conditions, camera poses or
   material. Moreover, the created images are labeled and ready to be
   trained in the model. Design/methodology/approachThis paper focuses on
   the challenges characterizing object detection models to enrich digital
   twins with facility management-related information. The automatic
   detection of small objects, such as sockets, power plugs, etc., requires
   big, labeled data sets that are costly and time-consuming to create.
   This study proposes a solution based on existing 3D BIM models to
   produce quick and automatically labeled synthetic images. FindingsThe
   paper presents a conceptual model for creating synthetic images to
   increase the performance in training object detection models for
   facility management. The results show that virtually generated images,
   rather than an alternative to real images, are a powerful tool for
   integrating existing data sets. In other words, while a base of real
   images is still needed, introducing synthetic images helps augment the
   model's performance and robustness in covering different types of
   objects. Originality/valueThis study introduced the first pipeline for
   creating synthetic images for facility management. Moreover, this paper
   validates this pipeline by proposing a case study where the performance
   of object detection models trained on real data or a combination of real
   and synthetic images are compared.},

Title = {Shaping the future of facility management. Market and literature
   insights on digital twin adoption},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 21},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to investigate the readiness of facility
   management (FM) to digitalize the construction sector by adopting
   digital technologies, especially the digital twin (DT). After the
   analysis of the literature, the study investigates opportunities and
   challenges recognized by the market.Design/methodology/approachTo
   collect market perceptions of digital uptake in FM, the participatory
   action research (PAR) methodology is adopted as a collaborative research
   approach that involves researchers and participants working together to
   identify a problem, collect and analyze data and take action to create
   meaningful change. PAR is iteratively applied in three phases. First, a
   comparison approach analyses three literature and two case studies.
   Second, a questionnaire survey retrieves insights from the market.
   Finally, interviews to FM operators are conducted to discuss the
   outcomes of the previous two phases.FindingsSurvey results and case
   studies comparison highlight growing interest in DT but a gap in its
   implementation. DT has the potential to transform FM by enhancing
   efficiency, predictive maintenance, energy optimization and lifecycle
   management. However, adoption is hindered by high costs, integration
   challenges and the need for specialized training. Case studies emphasize
   the importance of data-driven decision-making and clear client
   objectives. While Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and Big
   Data are key enablers, issues like data processing and interoperability
   remain. Overcoming these barriers will require standardization, cost
   reduction and workforce upskilling, making strategic investment in
   digital transformation crucial for long-term
   sustainability.Originality/valueThis paper elaborates a comprehensive
   assessment of FM readiness for digital transformation through the
   adoption of DT. By combining literature analysis, case studies
   comparison, surveys and interviews, the study provides a relevant
   perspective on the opportunities and challenges associated with DT
   implementation, bridging the gap between academic research and market
   operations.},

Title = {From BIM to Digital Twin: A transformation process through advanced
   control modeling and automated commissioning using daylight and
   artificial lighting as examples},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {329},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {An essential part of commissioning is verifying that the implemented
   systems are operating in accordance with the functional specifications.
   Commissioning also represents the handover between design and operation
   and is therefore an interface between different stakeholders. Building
   Information Modeling (BIM), as a platform for collaboration and
   information sharing, offers potential for both pre-commissioning, by
   providing evaluation options prior to implementation, and for automated
   commissioning of building control systems, by reducing on-site effort
   and the risk of error. However, current BIM approaches largely neglect
   this step due to a lack of modeling support. BIM is often seen as a key
   technology for digital twins. This transformation process can take place
   through the modeling of building control systems, which represent the
   interface between operation and design and can capture all relevant
   operating parameters. By integrating the model with data from simulation
   during early design and during the life of a building, a digital
   twin-based assessment of a building's energy performance throughout its
   life-cycle becomes possible. To realize these benefits, model-based
   engineering for model-based building commissioning is used to develop a
   digital twin that improves building operations through data-driven
   simulation. The resulting model-based tool environment encompasses an
   agile and continuous engineering process that is aligned with the
   building life-cycle and addresses current BIM characteristics according
   to the standard. Our evaluation using the Technology Acceptance Model
   confirms that the proposal presented is practical to implement and
   contributes to improving building operations. This is achieved by
   simplifying the pre-configuration, simulation-based evaluation and
   automated commissioning of building control systems for the subsequent
   commissioning of digital twins.},

   consumption while increasing thermal comfort. The framework is developed
   to help the facility managers better understand the building operation
   to enhance the HVAC system function. The Digital Twin framework is based
   on Building Information Modelling (BIM) combined with a newly created
   plug-in to receive real-time sensor data as well as thermal comfort and
   optimization process through Matlab programming. In order to determine
   if the suggested framework is practical, data were collected from a
   Norwegian office building between August 2019 and October 2021 and used
   to test the framework. An artificial neural network (ANN) in a Simulink
   model and a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) are then used to
   improve the HVAC system. The HVAC system is comprised of air
   distributors, cooling units, heating units, pressure regulators, valves,
   air gates, and fans, among other components. In this context, several
   characteristics, such as temperatures, pressure, airflow, cooling and
   heating operation control, and other factors are considered as decision
   variables. In order to determine objective functions, the predicted
   percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) and the HVAC energy usage are both
   calculated. As a result, ANN's decision variables and objective function
   correlated well. Furthermore, MOGA presents different design factors
   that can be used to obtain the best possible solution in terms of
   thermal comfort and energy usage.The results show that the average
   cooling energy savings for four days in summer is roughly 13.2\%, and
   10.8\% for the three summer months (June, July, and August), keeping the
   PPD under 10\%. Finally, compared to traditional approaches, the HVACDT
   framework displays a higher level of automation in terms of data
   management.},

Title = {Extended Reality for Smart Building Operation and Maintenance: A Review},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The operation and maintenance (O\&M) of buildings and infrastructure
   represent a strategic activity to ensure they perform as expected over
   time and to reduce energy consumption and maintenance costs at the urban
   and building scale. With the increasing diffusion of BIM, IoT devices,
   and AI, the future of O\&M is represented by digital twin technology. To
   effectively take advantage of this digital revolution, thus enabling
   data-driven energy control, proactive maintenance, and predictive daily
   operations, it is vital that smart building management exploits the
   opportunities offered by the extended reality (XR) technologies.
   Nevertheless, in consideration of the novelty of XR in the AECO sector
   and its rapid and ongoing evolution, knowledge of the specific
   possibilities and the methods of integration into the building process
   workflow is still piecemeal and sparse. With the goal to bridge this
   gap, the article presents a thorough review of virtual reality (VR),
   augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) technologies and
   applications for smart building operation and maintenance. After
   defining VR, AR, and MR, the article provides a detailed review that
   analyzes, categorizes, and summarizes state-of-the-art XR technologies
   and their possible applications for building O\&M along with their
   relative advantages and disadvantages. The article concludes that the
   application of XR in building and city management is showing promising
   results in enhancing human performance in technical O\&M tasks, in
   understanding and controlling the energy efficiency, comfort, and safety
   of building and infrastructures, and in supporting strategic decision
   making for the future smart city.},

   Using Information Based on Digital Twin},
Journal = {ENERGIES},

Volume = {16},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With the development and popularization of the Internet of Things, big
   data, cloud computing, and other technologies, Digital twin technology
   (DTT) is increasingly applied to building operation and maintenance
   (O\&M). However, most of the research focuses on building energy
   consumption, safety, and other management, and relatively little
   research on the monitoring of building terminal energy using
   information. The information is closely related to occupants' behavior,
   such as air conditioning, lighting, shading, window status information,
   as well as personnel number and location, and it has a great impact on
   building energy consumption. Due to different occupants' behaviors, the
   level of building energy consumption varies several times or even more.
   Take an office building as an example. Based on digital twin technology,
   the framework of building energy using intelligent monitoring is
   constructed. It mainly includes four parts, namely building physical
   space, virtual twin space, predictive control simulation engine, and
   twin big data. For each part, functions are realized through building
   Information Modelling (BIM), smart sensors, and Internet of Things (IoT)
   technologies. Based on the standard framework and every function
   realization method, the DTT can used for building O\&M effectually. The
   application of building an intelligent control system based on the
   occupants' characteristics is simulated and analyzed in Designbuilder
   software 6.1.2. The results show that the digital technology application
   in building intelligent control systems can realize maximum energy
   saving for 30\%. However, the DTT in building O\&M is not widely used
   now. There is a lot of research to be completed in the future.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},

Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Implementing Digital Twin (DT) technology in Operation and Maintenance
   (O\&M) heavily relies on the continuous availability of information
   regarding asset conditions and performances. Therefore, this study aims
   to establish comprehensive guidelines for defining information
   requirements for various O\&M tasks during the design phase. To achieve
   this objective, data collection, interviews, and investigations were
   conducted to develop an O\&M requirements system, including model
   requirements, function requirements, and nongeometric data requirements.
   The importance and attributes of requirement factors were analyzed
   through the Kano-QFD model. Based on the O\&M requirements system, a
   virtual assistant framework named ``DT-GPT{''} that utilizes the
   Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) was developed to assist owners
   in creating guidelines according to their requirements. Evaluations and
   a case study were introduced to validate the potential of DT-GPT.
   Results illustrated that DT-GPT had a mean semantic similarity of 87.28
   \% in generating function lists, a mean accuracy of 92.76 \% in
   extracting components from design drawings, and a mean semantic
   similarity of 96.34 \% in generating nongeometric data lists. The case
   study further demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework
   in assisting owners with the creation of O\&M guidelines. This study
   provides valuable insights for identifying O\&M management requirements
   and advancing the practical application of DT in O\&M processes.},

Abstract = {At present, building information modeling (BIM) has been developed into
   a digital backbone of the architecture, engineering, and construction
   industry. Also, recent decades have witnessed the fast development of
   various AI techniques in reliably tackling a huge amount of data under
   complex and uncertain environments. Since both BIM and artificial
   intelligence (AI) have attracted sustainable attention, the integration
   of BIM and AI can demonstrate newly added value in handling construction
   projects with inherent complexity and uncertainty. For a clear
   understanding of BIM-AI integration in boosting smart construction
   management, the goal of this paper is to make a comprehensive
   investigation and summary of its potential value and practical utility
   to drive the construction industry to catch up with the fast pace of
   automation and digitalization. Through both the bibliometric analysis
   and information analysis, this paper provides a deep insight into the
   status quo and future trends for leveraging AI during the entire
   lifecycle of a BIM-enabled project. It is worth noting that keywords
   that are highly cited in the latest two years contain deep learning,
   internet of things, digital twin, and others, which means AI is evolving
   as the next frontier to accelerate the revolution in the traditional
   civil engineering. According to keyword clusters derived from the
   log-likelihood ratio, we determine six advanced research interests and
   discuss the state-of-the-art research, including automated design and
   rule checking, 3D as-built reconstruction, event log mining, building
   performance analysis, virtual and augmented reality, and digital twin.
   Besides, a growing force can be put on three potential directions to
   more broadly adopt the BIM-AI integration, including synthesis of
   human-machine intelligence, civil-level digital twin, and blockchain,
   aiming to make BIM and AI live up to expectations.},

Title = {Digital twin-enabled anomaly detection for built asset monitoring in
   operation and maintenance},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Effective asset management plays a significant role in delivering the
   functionality and serviceability of buildings. However, there is a lack
   of efficient strategies and comprehensive approaches for managing assets
   and their associated data that can help to monitor, detect, record, and
   communicate operation and maintenance (O\&M) issues. With the importance
   of Digital Twin (DT) concepts being proven in the architecture,
   engineering, construction and facility management (AEC/FM) sectors, a
   DT-enabled anomaly detection system for asset monitoring and its data
   integration method based on extended industry foundation classes (IFC)
   in daily O\&M management are provided in this study. This paper presents
   a novel IFC-based data structure, using which a set of monitoring data
   that carries diagnostic information on the operational condition of
   assets is extracted from building DTs. Considering that assets run under
   changing loads determined by human demands, a Bayesian change point
   detection methodology that handles the contextual features of
   operational data is adopted to identify and filter contextual anomalies
   through cross-referencing with external operation information. Using the
   centrifugal pumps in the heating, ventilation and air-cooling (HVAC)
   system as a case study, the results indicate and prove that the novel
   DT-based anomaly detection process flow realizes a continuous anomaly
   detection of pumps, which contributes to efficient and automated asset
   monitoring in O\&M.},

Title = {Concert Halls as Nearly Adaptive Spaces},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Concert halls have led to increasingly complex spaces that cannot be
   thought of as static `containers' anymore. This complexity makes them
   viable to be launched towards industry 4.0 and to be considered a
   function of the activities that they can provide during their life
   cycle. They are characterized by dynamic objects that contain
   sophisticated sub-systems and add to the capability to influence both
   environmental variables and user behavior. This article explains an
   adaptive concert hall at an early stage, in which a network of sensors
   that gather real-time data on environmental factors such as temperature,
   air humidity and air velocity are considered, focusing on their direct
   and indirect intercorrelations with the acoustic quantities to optimize
   the room acoustic response. The proposed methodology is controlled by a
   digital twin (DT) based on building information modeling (BIM),
   integrated with sensors, actuators, and acoustic measurements and
   algorithms. By analyzing the data, algorithms identify patterns, and an
   autonomous fine-tune setting is achieved, including the novelty for
   which a natural variable acoustic field becomes possible during a
   musical execution without the use of any electroacoustic system support.
   The hall becomes a natural active instrument to be included in the
   composer's score. A case study is presented.},

Title = {Object verification based on deep learning point feature comparison for
   scan-to-BIM},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Building information models (BIMs) have been widely adopted in current
   construction projects to enhance the efficiency of facility maintenance
   operations. As-built BIMs can reflect the actual conditions of
   facilities and thus as-built BIM reconstruction has shown great
   significance in digital twin generation, building health monitoring,
   facility management and urban renewal. Laser scanners are capable to
   capture dense 3D measurements of the environment in a fast and highly
   accurate way. Therefore, laser scanning data have been widely used for
   as-built BIM generation. Although research efforts have been made on how
   to automatically achieve ``Scan-to-BIM ``, there are still gaps from
   applying current solutions to real scenarios. One of the challenges is
   that some irrelevant point clusters may be wrongly recognized as the
   desired object in the detection stage. This study presents a novel
   object verification approach based on deep learning point feature
   comparison to improve the accuracy of automated BIM reconstruction
   process. Firstly, a KPConv-based deep neural network is developed and
   trained to perform 3D point feature computation. Then through comparing
   point features calculated for extracted point clusters and as -designed
   BIM generated point clouds, point feature distance maps are generated.
   Afterwards, to automatically analyze the generated feature distance
   maps, a dataset including simulated positive and negative instances is
   created based on ModelNet40. And a tiny neural network is established
   and trained on the prepared dataset to acquire ability of
   distinguishment. To validate the feasibility of the proposed technique,
   experiments were conducted on both artificial point clouds and real scan
   data collected in one MEP room in a water treatment work in Hong Kong.
   It is demonstrated that the proposed technique can successfully filter
   out all the false positives in the Scan-to-BIM process, improving
   reconstruction accuracy significantly.},

Title = {Development of a Framework to Support Whole-Life-Cycle Net-Zero-Carbon
   Buildings through Integration of Building Information Modelling and
   Digital Twins},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Decision-making on whole-life-cycle net-zero-carbon buildings is
   critical for addressing carbon emission and environmental problems.
   However, there is a lack of a data integration framework and an open
   international standard approach integrating key decision variables to
   support scientific computations and decision-making for whole-life-cycle
   net-zero-carbon buildings. Building information modelling (BIM) is an
   open international standard representing building information. Digital
   Twin (DT) can capture and monitor real-time building conditions to
   facilitate building operation. Integrating information acquired by DT
   with BIM has considerable potential to enable an open international
   standard based computational representation of key decision variables
   throughout the whole-building life cycle process. This paper aims to
   develop a novel conceptual framework that integrates BIM and DT to
   support net-zero-carbon buildings. The framework is developed using an
   open international standard approach and the ontology-based
   representation method, to define key decision variables using entities,
   properties, and relationships, and integrates captured data via DT. The
   research makes significant contributions to enable net-zero-carbon
   buildings and paves the way for future research on an automated system
   to support decision-making for the whole-life-cycle net-zero-carbon
   buildings.},

Journal = {SOFTWAREX},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {29},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {IFC2BCM is a novel software tool designed to generate IndoorGML and
   Building Configuration Models (BCM) from IFC/BIM models. The primary
   motivation behind IFC2BCM is to develop a tool for generating BCM as the
   core foundation of a Spatial Design Support System that will evaluate
   layout designs of complex buildings such as hospitals regarding
   operational efficiency. The software addresses the need for detailed
   spatial network analysis and simulation modelling in complex
   environments, offering a semi-automatic process to convert IFC data into
   IndoorGML, and subsequently into a comprehensive BCM. The BCM generated
   by this tool consists of geometric, topological, semantic, and
   operational information, it supports applications such as space
   optimization, facility management, ensuring safety, and indoor
   navigation. More generally, the results are relevant to the study of
   complex buildings such as airports, transport hubs, public buildings,
   etc.},

Abstract = {The digital transformation in management of the built environment is
   more and more evident. While the benefits of location data, from
   Building Information Modelling or Geographical Information Systems, have
   been explored separately, their combination - GeoBIM - in asset
   management has never been explored. Data collection for condition
   assessment is challenging due to quantity, types, frequency and quality
   of data. We first describe the opportunities and challenges of GeoBIM
   for condition assessment. The theoretical approach is then validated
   developing an integrated GeoBIM model of the digital built environment,
   for a neighbourhood in Milan, Italy. Data are collected, linked,
   processed and analysed, through multiple software platforms, providing
   relevant information for asset management decision making. Good results
   are achieved in rapid massive data collection, improved visualisation,
   and analysis. While further testing and development is required, the
   case study outcomes demonstrated the innovation and the mid-term
   service-oriented potential of the proposed approach.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {150},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry,
   blockchain-driven integration technology (BDIT) has witnessed rapid
   development. A critical literature review of BDIT can contribute toward
   innovation for the AEC industry. In this study, a quantitative mapping
   of 247 BDIT literatures from 2017 to 2022 was conducted. Following the
   clue of quantitative work, two critical levels of technological
   development and application for BDIT were analyzed. The findings
   suggest: (1) the technological developments of BDIT may involve
   technological integration (i.e., integration of blockchain and internet
   of thing/building information modeling/edge computing) and knowledge
   framework; and (2) the technological applications of BDIT may involve
   information automation management and building information management.
   To further explore the trends of BDIT, some future evolutions (i.e.,
   integration of blockchain and federated learning/digital
   twin/cloud-edge-end), application scenarios and challenges of BDIT were
   discussed. This study provides valuable theoretical and practical
   references for future research on BDIT in the AEC industry.},

Title = {Enhancing energy performance assessment and labeling in buildings: A
   review of BIM-based approaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {103},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Buildings are central to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions. However, energy labeling programs, intended to encourage
   sustainable practices, often encounter challenges such as data
   inaccuracies, manual processes, and discrepancies between estimated and
   actual energy consumption. This study examines how Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) can contribute to improving the accuracy, reliability,
   and efficiency of energy labeling, addressing existing gaps in current
   practices. Through a systematic literature review, the research compiles
   insights from recent studies that demonstrate BIM's potential to
   centralize and automate building data, reduce errors in energy
   assessments, and facilitate integration with Building Energy Modeling
   (BEM) tools for more consistent simulations. The findings indicate that
   BIM-based methods, including model generation techniques,
   multi-objective optimization, and digital twin applications, help
   mitigate the performance gap by enabling data updates, improving
   interoperability, and offering better occupant behavior modeling.
   Nevertheless, several challenges remain, such as ensuring data quality,
   enhancing open data standards, and refining tools to accommodate
   evolving energy systems. A key novelty of this review lies in
   synthesizing a broad range of BIM-driven approaches into a cohesive
   perspective on how energy labeling can be modernized and enriched. By
   proposing future research paths that further integrate these BIM-based
   solutions, this study underscores BIM's capacity to streamline labeling
   processes through advanced analytics and automation, ultimately
   supporting more informed retrofits, regulatory compliance, and
   sustainable design strategies. In summary, the review suggests that BIM
   can enhance current labeling methodologies and contribute to broader
   sustainability goals in the built environment.},

Title = {Virtual Building Models in built environments},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The global building sector plays a pivotal role in addressing
   sustainability, climate change, and carbon neutrality. This study
   introduces the original concept of virtual building models (VBMs)
   throughout the lifecycle of the building industry, considering the
   unique characteristics of this industry. VBMs are defined as
   mathematical models that represent the physical behavior of buildings
   throughout their lifecycle. These models consist of subvirtual models
   that represent the physical operational environments of the target
   building, encompassing physical variables, equipment, systems, indoor
   environments, and structural and material behaviors. This concept can
   contribute to achieving the existing concepts of building information
   modeling, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems within building
   operations, communities, and environments. In this study, building
   models are categorized into five aspects: virtual model environments,
   types, interactions, integrations, and levels of detail (LODs). The LODs
   are classified into five levels (LOD100, LOD200, LOD300, LOD350, and
   LOD400) depending on the primary environments of the virtual models and
   their coverage across the entire building. Virtual modeling
   methodologies are proposed considering the virtual model aspects to
   achieve higher or intended LOD states from both academic and industrial
   perspectives. Finally, future research directions are discussed to drive
   the concept of virtual buildings to shape the future of the building
   industry through digital transformations.},

Title = {Digital twins for decoding human-building interaction in multi-domain
   test-rooms for environmental comfort and energy saving via graph
   representation},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {279},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Human comfort studies are a complex topic given their interdisciplinary
   and multi-stimuli nature. The integration of different sources of
   information from multi-domain experiments for occupants' environ-mental
   perception investigation can change the way that researchers perceived
   the interactions among building agents. This study aims to establish a
   new method for digital twin development from a test room for
   human-comfort and energy behavior analysis, through a Graph Neural
   Network. An as-monitored BIM model was integrated with monitoring
   information, i.e., environmental data from the facility, physiolog-ical
   signals, and survey answers from occupants, and the relationships
   between the building agents were outlined, based on the experiment
   purposes. A real-world experiment was adopted to demonstrate the
   procedure and results, connecting the information from experiments and a
   test room facility employed to the study. The original approach filled a
   recurrent gap in human-comfort studies: the integration of all the
   sources of information in a single visual platform through Graph Neural
   Networks, allowing the recognition of patterns, connections, and the
   influence of the diverse stimuli in the human perception of the
   surrounding environment. In complex building systems, with large sensing
   structures, high occu-pancy and multi-source environmental stimuli, new
   conclusions can be drawn to a full understanding of the human-building
   interactions.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Since there is a growing interest in driving the digital transformation
   of the construction industry, the goal of this paper is to provide a
   full picture and understanding of the emerging research front on
   intelligent construction. Through the quantitative and qualitative
   analysis, relevant pieces of literature are thoroughly reviewed to
   extract useful knowledge to raise awareness of intelligent construction,
   resulting in the summary of research status and the determination of
   future needs. In light of the research findings, the rapid development
   of intelligent construction follows the strategies of standardization,
   digitization, intellectualization, collaboration, greenization, and
   customization, which mainly support ``4S{''} technologies. The popular
   research topics covering intelligent engineering services for the
   project's full lifecycle (i.e., design, construction, operation, and
   maintenance) and even the city level have been deeply explored, which
   are proven to dramatically improve project efficiency, safety, and
   automation. Moreover, challenges exist in three potential paths for
   future research, including the digital twin-enabled engineering cloud
   platform, man-machine-environment interaction, great sustainability
   under carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. As for the practical
   value, a synthesized point of up-to-date reference is created to guide
   managers to promote intelligent construction in real-world engineering.},

Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {This study integrates quantitative scientometric analysis with a
   qualitative systematic review to comprehensively examine the evolution,
   core research themes, and emerging trends of three-dimensional (3D)
   visualization technology in architectural heritage conservation from
   2005 to 2024. A total of 813 relevant publications were retrieved from
   the Web of Science Core Collection and analyzed using CiteSpace to
   construct a detailed knowledge map of the field. The findings highlight
   that foundational technologies such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS),
   photogrammetry, building information modeling (BIM), and heritage
   building information modeling (HBIM) have laid a solid technical
   foundation for accurate heritage documentation and semantic
   representation. At the same time, the integration of digital twins, the
   Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and immersive
   technologies has facilitated a shift from static documentation to
   dynamic perception, real-time analysis, and interactive engagement. The
   analysis identifies four major research domains: (1) 3D data acquisition
   and modeling techniques, (2) digital heritage documentation and
   information management, (3) virtual reconstruction and interactive
   visualization, and (4) digital transformation and cultural narrative
   integration. Based on these insights, this study proposes four key
   directions for future research: advancing intelligence and automation in
   3D modeling workflows; enhancing cross-platform interoperability and
   semantic standardization; realizing the full lifecycle management of
   architectural heritage; and enhancing cultural narratives through
   digital expression. This study provides a systematic and in-depth
   understanding of the role of 3D visualization in architectural heritage
   conservation. It offers a solid theoretical foundation and strategic
   guidance for technological innovation, policy development, and
   interdisciplinary collaboration in the digital heritage field.},

Abstract = {Purpose In recent years, 3D printing technologies have been widely used
   in the construction industry. 3D printing in construction is very
   attractive because of its capability of process automation and the
   possibility of saving labor, waste materials, construction time and
   hazardous procedures for humans. Significant researches were conducted
   to identify the performance of the materials, while some researches
   focused on the development of novel techniques and methods, such as
   building information modeling. This paper aims to provide a detailed
   overview of the state-of-the-art of currently used 3D printing
   technologies in the construction areas and global acceptance in its
   applications. Design/methodology/approach The working principle of
   additive manufacturing in construction engineering (CE) is presented in
   terms of structural design, materials used and theoretical background of
   the leading technologies that are used to construct buildings and
   structures as well as their distinctive features. Findings The trends of
   3D printing processes in CE are very promising, as well as the
   development of novel materials, will gain further momentum. The findings
   also indicate that the digital twin (DT) in construction technology
   would bring the industry a step forward toward achieving the goal of
   Industry 5.0. Originality/value This review highlights the prospects of
   digital manufacturing and the DT in construction engineering. It also

Title = {Steel Construction 4.0: Systematic Review of Digitalization and
   Automatization Maturity in Steel Construction},

Abstract = {Construction 4.0 is propelling the construction sector towards a
   digital, automated, and sustainable framework. This paper reviews
   advancements in automation and digitalization within the steel
   construction industry, framed by the principles of Construction 4.0. An
   analysis of the existing literature indicates that previous review
   studies have explored the technologies and concepts associated with
   Construction 4.0. However, none have consolidated these technologies and
   concepts (T\&C) specifically within the context of the steel
   construction industry to evaluate their impact on steel manufacturing
   and assembly processes which was the main criterion for article
   selection. Therefore, this paper aims to consolidate various
   Construction 4.0 technologies and concepts to explore their integration
   into the steel construction industry. Based on data from the Web of
   Science and Scopus, a thorough screening process identified 56 out of
   161 articles for analysis regarding their applicability to the steel
   construction industry. The evolution of various technologies in the
   steel construction industry has been examined over the years, starting
   with the initial references to each technology. In addition to
   discussing the advancements of these technologies and their influence on
   contemporary digitalization and automation within the steel sector, the
   authors seek to identify which T\&C are most commonly utilized in
   manufacturing and assembly processes. The graphical results of this
   review indicate that each type of T\&C can serve as a tool for quality
   control throughout the manufacturing and assembly processes. However, it
   is noteworthy that most research remains concentrated on enhancing
   material tracking and identification during these stages of production.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) technology has received immense attention over the
   years due to the promises it presents to various stakeholders in science
   and engineering. As a result, different thematic areas of DT have been
   explored. This is no different in specific fields such as manufacturing,
   automation, oil and gas, and civil engineering, leading to fragmented
   approaches for field-specific applications. The civil engineering
   industry is further disadvantaged in this regard as it relies on
   external techniques by other engineering fields for its DT adoption. A
   rising consequence of these extensions is a concentrated application of
   DT to the operations and maintenance phase. On another spectrum,
   building information modeling (BIM) is pervasively utilized in the
   planning/design phase, and the transient nature of the construction
   phase remains a challenge for its DT adoption. In this article, we
   present a phase-based development of DT in the architecture,
   engineering, and construction industry. We commence by presenting
   succinct expositions on DT as a concept and as a service, and establish
   a five-level scale system. Furthermore, we present separately a
   systematic literature review of the conventional techniques employed at
   each civil engineering phase. In this regard, we identified enabling
   technologies such as computer vision for extended sensing and the
   Internet of things for reliable integration. Ultimately, we attempt to
   reveal DT as an important tool across the entire life cycle of civil
   engineering projects, and nudge researchers to think more holistically
   in their quest for the integration of DT for civil engineering
   applications.},

Title = {The hype factor of digital technologies in AEC},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {899-916},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to focus on 11 digital technologies (i.e. building
   information modeling, artificial intelligence and machine learning, 3D
   scanning, sensors, robots/automation, digital twin, virtual reality, 3D
   printing, drones, cloud computing and self-driving vehicles) that are
   portrayed in future trend reports and hype curves. The study
   concentrates on the current usage and knowledge of digital technologies
   in the Swedish architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry
   to gain an insight in the possible expectations and future trajectory of
   these digital technologies.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study applies an abductive approach which is based on three
   different types of methods. These methods are a literature and document
   study which focused on 11 digital technologies, two workshops with
   industry (13 participants) and an online survey (N = 84).
   Findings
   The paper contributes to a current state analysis of the Swedish AEC
   industry concerning digital technologies and discusses the trajectory of
   these technologies for the AEC industry. The paper identifies hype
   factors, in which the knowledge of a digital technology is related to
   its usage. From the hype factors, four zones that show different stages
   of digital technology usage and maturity in the industry are induced.
   Originality/value
   The contribution of the paper is twofold. The paper shows insight into
   opportunities, the current barriers, use and knowledge of digital
   technologies for the different actors in the AEC industry. Furthermore,
   the study shows that the AEC industry is behind the traditional Gartner
   hype curves and contributes with defining four zones for digital
   technologies for the Swedish AEC industry: confusion, excitement,
   experimentation and integration.},

Title = {Building on Digital Twin: Overcoming Barriers and Unlocking Success in
   the Construction Industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) link physical and virtual spaces, providing
   analytical and diagnostic value for built assets. Despite DT's potential
   benefits, its adoption in the construction industry is nascent, hindered
   by underexplored barriers and a lack of practical strategies. This study
   (1) identified barriers to DT adoption, (2) proposes strategies to spur
   DT adoption, and (3) prioritizes identified barriers and strategies and
   assesses the varying perceptions of organizations with different types
   and sectors on these factors. This study conducted a comprehensive
   literature review and content analysis, complemented by pilot
   interviews, to identify and categorize 25 barriers and 23 strategies. A
   survey questionnaire was distributed to industry professionals, and 91
   valid responses were received for analysis. The survey and postsurvey
   interviews helped prioritize these barriers and strategies and assess
   different construction organizations' perceptions of DT adoption.
   Additionally, two case studies were conducted to gain deeper insights
   into DT's real-world applications, barriers, and strategies. This study
   enriches the knowledge base by identifying and assessing the barriers
   and strategies for DT adoption and provides construction practitioners
   with actionable guidance for adopting DT.
   This study presents five key insights for implementing digital twins in
   the construction industry. First, it identified 25 barriers and 23
   strategies for DT adoption. Practitioners should pay attention to the
   top barriers, such as cost pressures, lack of models and data, and
   uncertain economic returns, while prioritizing effective strategies such
   as senior management support, clear objectives and expected outcomes
   from clients, and financial subsidies. Second, facility management (FM)
   and architect organizations face more challenges in adopting DT, so
   their needs should be prioritized when applying strategies. Third, the
   private sector, particularly small and medium enterprises, encounters
   greater challenges in DT adoption than the public sector due to limited
   IT infrastructure. Collaboration between the public and private sectors
   is recommended to overcome this challenge. Fourth, senior management
   plays a crucial role in creating a DT-friendly environment by training
   DT-competent employees and shifting conservative organizational
   cultures. The study presents two real-life examples of successful DT
   adoption in construction, providing valuable insights for practitioners.},

Title = {Visualised inspection system for monitoring environmental anomalies
   during daily operation and maintenance},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {27},
Number = {8, SI},
Pages = {1835-1852},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {Purpose Visual inspection and human judgement form the cornerstone of
   daily operations and maintenance (O\&M) services activities carried out
   by facility managers nowadays. Recent advances in technologies such as
   building information modelling (BIM), distributed sensor networks,
   augmented reality (AR) technologies and digital twins present an immense
   opportunity to radically improve the way daily O\&M is conducted. This
   paper aims to describe the development of an AR-supported automated
   environmental anomaly detection and fault isolation method to assist
   facility managers in addressing problems that affect building occupants'
   thermal comfort. Design/methodology/approach The developed system
   focusses on the detection of environmental anomalies related to the
   thermal comfort of occupants within a building. The performance of three
   anomaly detection algorithms in terms of their ability to detect indoor
   temperature anomalies is compared. Based on the fault tree analysis
   (FTA), a decision-making tree is developed to assist facility management
   (FM) professionals in identifying corresponding failed assets according
   to the detected anomalous symptoms. The AR system facilitates easy
   maintenance by highlighting the failed assets hidden behind
   walls/ceilings on site to the maintenance personnel. The system can thus
   provide enhanced support to facility managers in their daily O\&M
   activities such as inspection, recording, communication and
   verification. Findings Taking the indoor temperature inspection as an
   example, the case study demonstrates that the O\&M management process
   can be improved using the proposed AR-enhanced inspection system.
   Comparative analysis of different anomaly detection algorithms reveals
   that the binary segmentation-based change point detection is effective
   and efficient in identifying temperature anomalies. The decision-making
   tree supported by FTA helps formalise the linkage between temperature
   issues and the corresponding failed assets. Finally, the AR-based model
   enhanced the maintenance process by visualising and highlighting the
   hidden failed assets to the maintenance personnel on site.
   Originality/value The originality lies in bringing together the advances
   in augmented reality, digital twins and data-driven decision-making to
   support the daily O\&M management activities. In particular, the paper
   presents a novel binary segmentation-based change point detection for
   identifying temperature anomalous symptoms, a decision-making tree for
   matching the symptoms to the failed assets, and an AR system for
   visualising those assets with related information.},

Title = {Quantifying the Impact of Technology Utilization on Schedule and Cost
   Performance in Construction Projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {There has been a plethora of research on the performance of schedule and
   cost in construction projects. However, current research falls short in
   investigating the combined contribution of different construction
   technologies on project performance metrics. Specifically, none of the
   previous efforts have used integrated earned value management (EVM)
   parameters and utilized construction technologies to assess project
   schedule and cost performance. This paper fills this knowledge gap. To
   this end, a multistep research methodology was employed to (1) explore
   the utilization ratings of 13 construction technologies based on data
   collected from 52 industry experts; (2) rank these technologies in terms
   of their contribution to schedule and cost savings; (3) map the
   utilization ratings of construction technologies to schedule and cost
   variances by leveraging data from 48 construction projects with varying
   levels and scopes of technology integration to gauge the impact of using
   these technologies; and (4) develop an associated decision-support model
   that underwent rigorous verification under extreme conditions and
   sensitivity analysis. This study makes a noteworthy contribution to the
   existing body knowledge, revealing that the major drivers for schedule
   savings are building information modeling (BIM), unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs), and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), while additive
   manufacturing (AM), digital twin (DT), and Internet of Things (IoT) are
   the most significant contributors to cost savings. Moreover, the study
   reveals strong correlations between various technologies, such as UAVs
   and laser scanning, geographic information system (GIS) and GPS, AR/VR
   and digital twins, as well as robotics/automation and AR/VR.
   Furthermore, the study introduces a novel model that enhances the
   prediction of project performance, specifically in terms of schedule and
   cost variations resulting from the adoption of various construction
   technologies. Eventually, it improves the decision-making process
   related to the deployment of the investigated construction technologies.},

Title = {A Review of the Digital Twin Technology in the AEC-FM Industry},

Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management
   (AEC-FM) industry is increasingly affected by digital technologies that
   monitor sensor network data and control automation systems. Advances in
   digital technologies like Digital Twin offer a high-level representation
   of buildings and their assets by integrating the physical and digital
   world. This paper examines patterns, gaps, and trends in the AEC-FM
   sector and contributes to digitalization and automation solutions for
   building management. This work covers a broad range of research topics,
   from intelligent information management of complex models to building
   information management and the interaction of building systems, where
   researchers are increasingly interested in using the Digital Twin to
   manage their information and in developing new research lines focused on
   data interchange and the interoperability of building information
   modeling (BIM) and facility management (FM). After a complete
   bibliometric search of several databases and following selection
   criteria, 77 academic publications about the Digital Twin application in
   the AEC-FM industry were labeled and clustered accordingly. This study
   analyzed in detail the concept of key technologies, including ``Digital
   Twin in Facility Lifecycle Management,{''} ``Digital Twin-Information
   Integration Standards,{''} ``Digital Twin-Based Occupants Centric
   Building Design,{''} ``Digital Twin-Based Predictive Maintenance,{''}
   ``Semantic Digital Twin for Facility Maintenance,{''} and ``Digital
   Twin-Based Human Knowledge.{''} The findings show that information
   standardization is the first major hurdle that must be overcome before
   the actual use of Digital Twin can be realized in the AEC-FM industry.
   Based on that, this paper provides a conceptual framework of Digital
   Twin for building management as a starting point for future research.},

Abstract = {Digital twins aim to virtually replicate the static and dynamic building
   characteristics through real-time connectivity between virtual and
   physical counterparts. Despite its potential, research into digital
   twins for facility management (FM) in multipurpose spaces is at an early
   stage, especially to control and optimize the various uses and
   configuration layouts. One of the major barriers to the adoption of
   digital twin technology in multipurpose buildings is the lack of
   interoperability, primarily between building information modeling (BIM)
   and Internet of things (IoT) data sources. This paper presents a
   possible digital-twin architecture to enable digital-twin applications
   aiming to impact building performance, acting on the facility management
   of stagecraft and variable acoustic architectural elements to control
   the reverberation time in real time. The case study of Roberto De Silva
   Multipurpose Hall is presented, in which the indoor acoustic quality is
   controlled by the digital twin that returns the reverberation time
   output as a function of stage equipment layouts, variable acoustic
   elements and hall occupancy.},

   Article)},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {The high operation cost of green building, insufficient
   informationization and automation management capability, and the lack of
   effective operation cost control seriously restrict the development of
   the industry and the realization of green goals. In order to solve the
   problem of insufficient capability of green building operation cost
   management, based on the digital twin technology in the manufacturing
   field, we analyze the characteristic requirements and theoretical basis
   of green building operation cost management for system, propose a green
   building operation cost management system based on digital twin, and
   refine the design of each structural layer of this system. It is
   necessary to set up a series of lines, although it takes a certain
   amount of time. There are four types of applications, namely, the number
   of types of applications, the completion of the effective number, the
   comparison of functions, and the implementation capabilities. The study
   shows that the proposed system framework can improve the efficiency and
   quality of green building operation cost management through technology
   upgrade and process optimization. The implementation of digital twin and
   human-machine collaboration is an advanced stage in the development of
   digital architecture because virtual things and real things, materials,
   and numbers are mutually promoting processes. The inspiration of this
   technological view for architecture is that digital twin and
   human-machine collaboration not only allow the interaction between
   virtual and reality and emphasize the feedback of actual construction to
   virtual simulation but also promote a kind of mutual promotion of human
   and machine thinking and construction ability.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a next-generation smart
   building management solution, seamlessly bridging traditional Building
   Automation Systems (BAS) with Industry 4.0 innovations such as Building
   Information Modelling (BIM), artificial intelligence (AI), big data,
   Internet of Things (IoT), and Extended Reality (XR). However, current DT
   applications in building operations remain nascent, challenged by
   multi-source data integration, technology interoperability, and
   visualization interface development. This study proposes a fivelayer DT
   architecture integrating BIM, BAS, IoT, AI, and MR for 3D interactive
   building operations, implemented on a typical floor of a high-rise
   office building incorporating its central air conditioning system. The
   DT demonstrated both on-site and remote capabilities, including BIM
   visualization, mapping and navigation, indoor environment monitoring,
   portable HVAC system monitoring and control, and AI-empowered
   optimization. These capabilities represent significant advantages in
   terms of operation management, work efficiency, operator experience and
   response speed.},

Title = {Developing a conceptual framework for the application of digital twin
   technologies to revamp building operation and maintenance processes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Globally, the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) industry has
   seen a rise in the adoption of digital twin (DT) technologies due to
   their potential to enhance collaboration and information communication
   throughout the project lifecycle from the design to operation and
   maintenance (O \& M) phase. However, empirical evidence on such adoption
   is fragmented, particularly for facility management (FM) activities
   during the O \& M phase. Considering this gap, an illustrative case
   study approach is performed to analyze and compare the traditional
   practices of FM with DT-driven FM during the O \& M phase using four
   geospatially representative cases. The findings show that DT
   technologies enable efficient and responsive planning and control of FM
   activities by providing real-time status of the building assets.
   However, barriers such as the misalignment of the data integration and
   data standards hamper their future implementation. To address this, a
   bottom-up conceptual framework is proposed to facilitate a wider
   implementation of DT technologies and support FM during the O \& M phase
   of buildings. As such, this paper's contribution is twofold: (1) it
   provides an aggregate landscape of DT application to manage facilities
   during the O \& M phase, and (2) it develops an evidence-induced
   conceptual framework for stakeholders who are grappling with their FM
   decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {PurposeCircular economy (CE) principles can enhance the sustainability
   and regenerative potential of built environments through facility
   management (FM). This study aims to explore how FM can support the
   implementation of CE during the use phase of a building, with a focus on
   applying digital twin technologies.Design/methodology/approachThe study

   X, circular FM is linked to building design strategies that improve
   adaptability, extend service life and promote collaboration among
   stakeholders. The implementation of a digital twin is crucial for
   efficient data management, which supports both FM services and CE
   principles, ultimately enhancing asset value.Originality/valueThe study
   provides a multi-stakeholder perspective on circular FM, reflecting on
   the possibility to achieve holistic value. It also contributes to

Title = {Semantic digital twin creation of building systems through time series
   based metadata inference - A review},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {321},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Numerous applications are being developed to enhance the energy
   efficiency of building systems, including fault detection and diagnosis,
   performance assessment, and intelligent control. For these applications
   to be effectively utilised, a data connection between the real and
   virtual worlds must be established. One potential solution to establish
   this connection and enable semantic enrichment of data with metadata is
   the semantic digital twin. Semantic digital twins use semantic
   technologies, such as ontologies, as metadata schemas. However, creating
   these twins requires substantial manual effort due to the need to
   examine diverse sources of information about the building systems and
   normalise this information into a metadata schema. This review
   investigates whether metadata inference based on time series data from
   building systems can assist in the automated creation of semantic
   digital twins. To this end, 53 artificial intelligence-based
   publications on metadata inference are analyzed for their applicability

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine and discuss the current
   patterns, gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the architectural,
   engineering, construction, operation, and facility management (AECO-FM)
   industry and to propose future directions for industry stakeholders. A
   bibliometric search was performed on 197 papers that were obtained from
   the Scopus database. 151 of those papers were used in the subsequent
   scientometric analysis and mapping to narrate the evolution of the
   research subject. The studies discussed in the paper cover a wide range
   of research from model-based information management to building
   information management, all the way to the interaction between buildings
   and smart cities. The `virtual-physical building integration', `building
   lifecycle management', and `information integrated production' subjects
   are highly in the focus of the research field. While `information-based
   predictive management' and `virtual-based information utilization'
   studies need to be addressed for a holistic Digital Twin adoption in the
   AECO-FM industry. Future studies should focus on the full integration of
   digital twin and its physical counterpart for better performance
   throughout the building life cycle. This study highlights the patterns,
   gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the AECO-FM industry and
   contributes to the state-of-the-art digitalization and automation
   approaches in the construction project management body of knowledge. The
   sample size is a limitation for this research since it is relatively
   small due to the newness of the subject. Future studies may include data
   related to practice-oriented innovations and industry-initiated
   improvements to achieve broader and more informed results.},

Title = {Digital Twin for Fault Detection and Diagnosis of Building Operations: A
   Systematic Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Intelligence in Industry 4.0 has led to the development of smart
   buildings with various control systems for data collection, efficient
   optimization, and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). However,
   buildings, especially with regard to heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning (HVAC) systems, are responsible for significant global
   energy consumption. Digital Twin (DT) technology offers a sustainable
   solution for facility management. This study comprehensively reviews DT
   performance evaluation in building life cycle and predictive
   maintenance. 200 relevant papers were selected using a systematic
   methodology from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, and various
   FDD methods were reviewed to identify their advantages and limitations.
   In conclusion, data-driven methods are gaining popularity due to their
   ability to handle large amounts of data and improve accuracy,
   flexibility, and adaptability. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning
   as data-driven methods are important for FDD in building operations,
   such as with HVAC systems, as they can handle unlabeled data and
   identify complex patterns and anomalies. Future studies should focus on
   developing interpretable models to understand how the models made their
   predictions. Hybrid methods that combine different approaches show
   promise as reliable methods for further research. Additionally, deep
   learning methods can analyze large and complex datasets, indicating a
   promising area for further investigation.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) are defined as capable of achieving some
   elements of cognition, notably memory (encoding and retrieval),
   perception (creating useful data representations), and reasoning
   (outlier and event detection). This paper presents the development of a
   CDT, populated by construction information, facility management data,
   and data streamed from the Building Automation System (BAS). Advanced
   machine learning was enabled by access to both real-time and historical
   data coupled with scalable cloud-based computational resources.
   Streaming data to the cloud has been implemented in existing
   architectures; to address security concerns from exposing building
   equipment to undesirable access, a secure streaming architecture from
   BACnet equipment to our research cloud is presented. Real-time data is
   uploaded to a high-performance scalable time-series database, while the
   ontology is stored on a relational database. Both data sources are
   integrated with Building Information Models (BIM) to aggregate, explore,
   and visualize information on demand. This paper presents a case study of
   a Digital Twin (DT) of an academic building where various capabilities
   of CDTs are demonstrated through a series of proof-of-concept examples.
   Drawing from our experience enhancing this implementation with elements
   of cognition, we present a development framework and reference
   architecture to guide future whole-building CDT research.},

Abstract = {The integration of the building information modelling (BIM) and assets
   database has enabled a potential pathway for building stakeholders to
   add value to the building lifecycle management (BLM) processes. However,
   the obtaining, storing, processing, and distributing of data have not
   been ratified in a detailed and semantic manner in any official
   guideline. This paper suggests a framework for the efficient development
   of an interoperable visualisation of a building ``digital twin{''}
   through an intuitive interface, to contribute to the idea above. The
   framework was applied in two case studies as examples, where rich
   visualisations of two buildings in the Kanta-flame region of Finland
   were constructed using their architectural models and building indoor
   climate metrics. By constructing an engaging interface, relevant metrics
   and constant feedback from buildings' occupants are gathered, meaningful
   data is selected, processed, and displayed to improve the facility
   management (FM) process. The yielded result is a progressive web
   application (PWA), where valuable sets of building performance data are
   visualised and a promptly communicable channel between owners/occupants
   and building system is delivered. Further development of this
   application in practice and research work is also proposed to harness
   the data-driven monitoring and automation in buildings to the greatest
   extent.},

Title = {Digital Twin of HVAC system (HVACDT) for multiobjective optimization of

Journal = {ADVANCES IN BUILDING ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {This study proposes a novel Digital Twin framework of heating,
   ventilation, and air conditioning (HVACDT) system to reduce energy
   consumption while increasing thermal comfort. The framework is developed
   to help the facility managers better understand the building operation
   to enhance the HVAC system function. The Digital Twin framework is based
   on Building Information Modelling (BIM) combined with a newly created
   plug-in to receive real-time sensor data as well as thermal comfort and
   optimization process through Matlab programming. In order to determine
   if the suggested framework is practical, data were collected from a
   Norwegian office building between August 2019 and October 2021 and used
   to test the framework. An artificial neural network (ANN) in a Simulink
   model and a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) are then used to
   improve the HVAC system. The HVAC system is comprised of air
   distributors, cooling units, heating units, pressure regulators, valves,
   air gates, and fans, among other components. In this context, several
   characteristics, such as temperatures, pressure, airflow, cooling and
   heating operation control, and other factors are considered as decision
   variables. In order to determine objective functions, the predicted
   percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) and the HVAC energy usage are both
   calculated. As a result, ANN's decision variables and objective function
   correlated well. Furthermore, MOGA presents different design factors
   that can be used to obtain the best possible solution in terms of
   thermal comfort and energy usage.The results show that the average
   cooling energy savings for four days in summer is roughly 13.2\%, and
   10.8\% for the three summer months (June, July, and August), keeping the
   PPD under 10\%. Finally, compared to traditional approaches, the HVACDT
   framework displays a higher level of automation in terms of data
   management.},

Abstract = {Analyzable data capturing physical entity activities is a prerequisite
   for complex hospital operational decisionmakings. However, there is a
   lack of effective strategies to integrate real-time data from multiple

   identified information needs and enabling technologies. A pilot platform
   is developed and tested in a Shanghai municipal hospital. The results
   indicate that the digital twinning method enables continuous real-time
   control of related operational tasks, and further promotes the
   development of digitization, automation, and intelligence in hospital

Title = {Integration of BIM Tools for the Facility Management of Railway Bridges},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Current railway infrastructure maintenance work, which is mostly carried
   out by visual inspection, has a reactive approach, dissociated
   information, and limited follow-up. On the other hand, railway bridges,
   being critical infrastructures, require effective monitoring and
   maintenance to guarantee their safety and operation over time. The
   designed tool links a parametric BIM model in Revit (R) with an
   automated spreadsheet in MS Excel (R) through visual programming in
   Dynamo, generating BIM/data automation as an initial step towards a
   digital twin. This achieves a bidirectional flow to exchange data on the
   structural condition of elements. The procedure was applied to a railway
   bridge in use for over 100 years, representing its geometry and damage
   information according to technical standards. The value lies in laying
   the foundations for adopting preventive approaches for this key
   infrastructure. The BIM/data automation allows the BIM model to visually
   reflect the condition of the elements, depending on their damage,
   consolidate the inspection information, and generate a visual management
   tool. In conclusion, the designed BIM/data automation improves the
   monitoring of railway bridges compared to traditional methods,
   facilitating the interaction and relationship between the damage records
   and the actual bridge elements, laying the foundations for the
   construction of digital twins.},

Title = {Digital twin-enabled human-robot collaborative teaming towards
   sustainable and healthy built environments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {412},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Development of sustainable and healthy built environments (SHBE) is
   highly advocated to achieve collective societal good. Part of the
   pathway to SHBE is the engagement of robots to manage the ever-complex
   facilities for tasks such as inspection and disinfection. However,
   despite the increasing advancements of robot intelligence, it is still
   ``mission impossible{''} for robots to independently undertake such
   open-ended problems as facility management, calling for a need to ``team
   up{''} the robots with humans. Leveraging digital twin's ability to
   capture real-time data and inform decision-making via dynamic
   simulation, this study aims to develop a human-robot teaming framework
   for facility management to achieve sustainability and healthiness in the
   built environments. A digital twin-enabled prototype system is developed
   based on the framework. Case studies showed that the framework can
   safely and efficiently incorporate robotics into facility management
   tasks (e.g., patrolling, inspection, and cleaning) by allowing humans to
   plan, oversee, manage, and cooperate with the robot via the digital
   twin's bi-directional mechanism. The study lays out a high-level
   framework, under which purposeful efforts can be made to unlock digital
   twin's full potential in collaborating humans and robots in facility
   management towards SHBE.},

Abstract = {This work demonstrates how a water and energy sustainable building's
   heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system may be operated
   to maximize condensate production while upholding user thermal comfort
   and energy consumption requirements. A physics-based HVAC condensate
   model was presented and validated against operating data from the
   Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design (KBISD), a
   3,437.4-m(2) (37,000-ft(2)) academic building on the Georgia Institute
   of Technology's Atlanta campus. A sensitivity study of the HVAC
   condensate production and power consumption was performed. Metamodels
   were developed to concisely yet accurately represent the physics-based
   model, and these were used as the basis of an optimization exercise to
   identify competitive operating conditions for maximizing condensate
   production. The case studies included here found optimized HVAC system
   operation strategies to produce up to 708\% more condensate. The
   demonstrated approach may be reproduced by system operators or building
   automation systems to increase condensate production without sacrificing
   building system-level energy and thermal comfort requirements.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {137},
Number = {A},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Since there is a growing interest in driving the digital transformation
   of the construction industry, the goal of this paper is to provide a
   full picture and understanding of the emerging research front on
   intelligent construction. Through the quantitative and qualitative
   analysis, relevant pieces of literature are thoroughly reviewed to
   extract useful knowledge to raise awareness of intelligent construction,
   resulting in the summary of research status and the determination of
   future needs. In light of the research findings, the rapid development
   of intelligent construction follows the strategies of standardization,
   digitization, intellectualization, collaboration, greenization, and
   customization, which mainly support ``4S{''} technologies. The popular
   research topics covering intelligent engineering services for the
   project's full lifecycle (i.e., design, construction, operation, and
   maintenance) and even the city level have been deeply explored, which
   are proven to dramatically improve project efficiency, safety, and
   automation. Moreover, challenges exist in three potential paths for
   future research, including the digital twin-enabled engineering cloud
   platform, man-machine-environment interaction, great sustainability
   under carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. As for the practical
   value, a synthesized point of up-to-date reference is created to guide
   managers to promote intelligent construction in real-world engineering.},

Title = {Digital twin framework to enhance facility management for relocatable
   modular buildings},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {176},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Relocatable modular buildings (RMBs) are gaining recognition for their
   innovation, efficiency, and sustainability, especially in addressing
   urgent needs during natural disasters or pandemics. Their inherent
   flexibility, mobility, and scalability enable rapid deployment and
   adaptation to changing needs. However, managing multiple modular units
   and their relocation and reconfiguration over time presents significant
   challenges. This paper proposes a digital twin framework that integrates
   building information modeling (BIM), the internet of things (IoT), and
   geographic information systems (GIS) to enhance facility management for
   RMBs. Through a detailed case study of a relocatable modular school
   system, the framework's application is illustrated, showcasing its
   ability to streamline lifecycle management of modular construction, from
   initial design and fabrication to deployment, operation, and
   reconfiguration. The results highlight the potential of digital twin
   technology in fostering more sustainable, efficient, and resilient
   modular building environments, contributing to the evolution of smart
   construction practices and adaptive architecture},

Abstract = {The digital twin is a rather new industrial control and automation
   systems concept. While the approach so far has gained interest mainly
   due to capabilities to make advanced simulations and optimizations,
   recently the possibilities for enhanced security have got attention
   within the research community. In this article, we discuss how a digital
   twin replication model and corresponding security architecture can be
   used to allow data sharing and control of security-critical processes.
   We identify design-driving security requirements for digital twin based
   data sharing and control. We show that the proposed state
   synchronization design meets the expected digital twin synchronization
   requirements and give a high-level design and evaluation of other
   security components of the architecture. We also make performance
   evaluations of a proof of concept for protected software upgrade using
   the proposed digital twin design. Our new security framework provides a
   foundation for future research work in this promising new area.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},

Abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) link physical and virtual spaces, providing
   analytical and diagnostic value for built assets. Despite DT's potential
   benefits, its adoption in the construction industry is nascent, hindered
   by underexplored barriers and a lack of practical strategies. This study
   (1) identified barriers to DT adoption, (2) proposes strategies to spur
   DT adoption, and (3) prioritizes identified barriers and strategies and
   assesses the varying perceptions of organizations with different types
   and sectors on these factors. This study conducted a comprehensive
   literature review and content analysis, complemented by pilot
   interviews, to identify and categorize 25 barriers and 23 strategies. A
   survey questionnaire was distributed to industry professionals, and 91
   valid responses were received for analysis. The survey and postsurvey
   interviews helped prioritize these barriers and strategies and assess
   different construction organizations' perceptions of DT adoption.
   Additionally, two case studies were conducted to gain deeper insights
   into DT's real-world applications, barriers, and strategies. This study
   enriches the knowledge base by identifying and assessing the barriers
   and strategies for DT adoption and provides construction practitioners
   with actionable guidance for adopting DT.
   This study presents five key insights for implementing digital twins in
   the construction industry. First, it identified 25 barriers and 23
   strategies for DT adoption. Practitioners should pay attention to the
   top barriers, such as cost pressures, lack of models and data, and
   uncertain economic returns, while prioritizing effective strategies such
   as senior management support, clear objectives and expected outcomes
   from clients, and financial subsidies. Second, facility management (FM)
   and architect organizations face more challenges in adopting DT, so
   their needs should be prioritized when applying strategies. Third, the
   private sector, particularly small and medium enterprises, encounters
   greater challenges in DT adoption than the public sector due to limited
   IT infrastructure. Collaboration between the public and private sectors
   is recommended to overcome this challenge. Fourth, senior management
   plays a crucial role in creating a DT-friendly environment by training
   DT-competent employees and shifting conservative organizational
   cultures. The study presents two real-life examples of successful DT
   adoption in construction, providing valuable insights for practitioners.},

   Diffusion Research},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study aimed to ascertain the research status of complexity issues
   in building information modeling (BIM) diffusion and identify future
   research directions in this field. A total of 366 relevant journal
   articles were holistically evaluated. The visualization analysis
   indicated that management aspects, emergent trends (such as green
   building, facility management, and automation), and theme clusters (such
   as interoperability, waste management, laser scanning, stakeholder
   management, and energy efficiency) are shaping BIM research towards
   complexity. Areas such as supply chain, cost, digital twin, and web are
   also essential. The manual qualitative evaluation classified the
   complexity issues in BIM diffusion research into three types
   (complexities of network-based BIM evolution, impact of BIM adoption
   circumstances, and BIM-based complexity reduction for informed decision
   making). It was concluded that BIM has been shifting towards information
   models and systems-based life cycle management, waste control for
   healthy urban environments, and complex data analysis from a big data
   perspective, not only in building projects but also in heritage and
   infrastructure, or at the city scale, for informed decision making and
   automatic responses. Future research should investigate the co-evolution
   between collaborative networks and BIM artefacts and work processes,
   quality improvement of BIM-based complex networks, BIM post-adoption
   behaviors influenced by complex environmental contexts, and BIM-based
   complexity reduction approaches.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The ever increasing pace of IoT deployment is opening the door to
   concrete implementations of smart city applications, enabling the
   large-scale sensing and modeling of (near-)real-time digital replicas of
   physical processes and environments. This digital replica could serve as
   the basis of a decision support system, providing insights into possible
   optimizations of resources in a smart city scenario. In this article, we
   discuss an extension of a prior work, presenting a detailed
   proof-of-concept implementation of a Digital Twin solution for the Urban
   Facility Management (UFM) process. The Interactive Planning Platform for
   City District Adaptive Maintenance Operations (IPPODAMO) is a
   distributed geographical system, fed with and ingesting heterogeneous
   data sources originating from different urban data providers. The data
   are subject to continuous refinements and algorithmic processes, used to
   quantify and build synthetic indexes measuring the activity level inside
   an area of interest. IPPODAMO takes into account potential interference
   from other stakeholders in the urban environment, enabling the informed
   scheduling of operations, aimed at minimizing interference and the costs
   of operations.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {With the rise of digital twin technology, the application of digital
   twin technology to industrial automation provides a new direction for
   the digital transformation of the global smart manufacturing industry.
   In order to further improve production efficiency, as well as realize
   enterprise digital empowerment, this paper takes a welding robot arm as
   the research object and constructs a welding robot arm digital twin
   system. Using three-dimensional modeling technology and model rendering,
   the welding robot arm digital twin simulation environment was built.
   Parent-child hierarchy and particle effects were used to truly restore
   the movement characteristics of the robot arm and the welding effect,
   with the help of TCP communication and Bluetooth communication to
   realize data transmission between the virtual segment and the physical
   end. A variety of UI components were used to design the human-machine
   interaction interface of the digital twin system, ultimately realizing
   the data-driven digital twin system. Finally, according to the digital
   twin maturity model constructed by Prof. Tao Fei's team, the system was
   scored using five dimensions and 19 evaluation factors. After testing
   the system, we found that the combination of digital twin technology and
   automation is feasible and achieves the expected results.},

Abstract = {Robotic automation has emerged as a leading solution for replacing human
   workers in dirty, dangerous, and demanding industries to ensure the
   safety of human workers. However, practical implementation of this
   technology remains limited, requiring substantial effort and costs. This
   study addresses the challenges specific to nuclear power plants,
   characterized by hazardous environments and physically demanding tasks
   such as nozzle dam replacement in confined workspaces. We propose a
   digital twin and deep-reinforcement-learning-driven robotic automation
   system with an autonomous mobile manipulator. The study follows a
   four-step process. First, we establish a simplified testbed for a nozzle
   dam replacement task and implement a high-fidelity digital twin model of
   the real-world testbed. Second, we employ a hybrid visual perception
   system that combines deep object pose estimation and an iterative
   closest point algorithm to enhance the accuracy of the six-dimensional
   pose estimation. Third, we use a deep-reinforcement-learning method,
   particularly the proximal policy optimization algorithm with inverse
   reachability map, and a centroidal waypoint strategy, to improve the
   controllability of an autonomous mobile manipulator. Finally, we conduct
   pre-performed simulations of the nozzle dam replacement in the digital
   twin and evaluate the system on a robot in the real-world testbed. The
   nozzle dam replacement with precise object pose estimation, navigation,
   target object grasping, and collision-free motion generation was
   successful. The robotic automation system achieved a 92.0\% success rate
   in the digital twin. Our proposed method can improve the efficiency and
   reliability of robotic automation systems for extreme workspaces and
   other perilous environments.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {With the prompt digital revolution in architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC), it is crucial to set the early practical steps for
   advanced digital technology namely digital twin technology. Although
   theoretical evidence on the potential of digital twins exists in AEC
   scope, the practical framework to the construction and operation of
   user-centred digital twin is yet to be investigated. Hence, this applied
   research investigates systematic methods and techniques for the
   construction and enablement of a user-centred digital twin paving the
   way to advanced digital applications in AEC centred on the user of the
   built environment. As a result, the framework unleashes a systematic
   roadmap to the creation and development of a city-scale digital twin
   centred on the human and capable of describing, analyzing, and assessing
   a built context per its users and usability manner. Further, the
   framework pours the foundations for a spectrum of digital twin
   applications in the scope of architectural design, building
   construction, infrastructure engineering, and facility management. The
   production of this research is foreseen to outline a systematic and
   transferable framework for the construction and enablement of a

Abstract = {Facility management is an essential part of the building which
   encompasses multiple service areas and processes to ensuring optimum
   functionality of the facility. Digital twin (DT) has been increasingly
   introduced to the FM domain to facilitate FM tasks such as
   decision-making. Despite the advancements in DT-enabled FM, there still
   exists a problem in the disconnections between DT academics and FM
   practitioners. The emergence of knowledge management can act as a bridge
   between academics and FM practitioners. To mine knowledge in the
   DT-enabled FM industry for a better communication between different
   stakeholders and timely decisions in the case of emergency, this study
   proposes a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach. A detailed
   classification of FM-related entities is first presented, which divides
   the FM into five categories. The NLP model is used to extract entities
   and knowledge from a large volume of text data. The results indicate
   that an NLP-based approach can accurately extract FM-related knowledge.
   The findings of this study not only provide a basis for automatic
   DT-enabled FM-related knowledge extraction but also support the
   downstream tasks such as knowledge graph construction and FM-related
   emergency decision-making.},

Abstract = {In the maintenance domain of the construction industry, digital twins
   have been actively introduced based on the technologies of the Fourth
   Industrial Revolution with growing interest in three-dimensional spatial
   information facility management and disaster response service using
   digital twin technology. In particular, disasters or abnormal situations
   in an underground utility tunnel (UTU) can cause serious casualties and
   property damage since key elements of a city such as power,
   communications, water supply, and heating facilities are collectively
   accommodated in a certain underground space. This study established the
   methodology for implementing an underground utility tunnel through a
   digital twin. The novelty of this study is demonstrating a sequential
   procedure of implementing digital twin technology by configuring major
   layers such as data acquisition, modeling, and service. This methodology
   can serve as reference material or a training aid for implementing a
   digital twin of underground facilities or underground utility tunnels in
   the future; the proposed methodology will be verified when an actual
   digital twin service is provided.},

Abstract = {The Digital Twin allows the merging of the physical and virtual worlds,
   having many applications in design and manufacturing. While the Digital
   Twin conceptual foundations are well developed, and fundamental
   integration technology is available, there is a gap related to generally
   applicable Digital Twin implementation approaches. Motivated by this,
   the paper presents a novel Digital Twin design and implementation
   approach that considers standard industrial automation technologies. The
   proposed approach relies on a solution architecture positioning
   Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) as a central element for Digital
   Twin deployment for industrial applications. The solution architecture
   enables a direct connection between the PLC and the Digital Twin
   platform. The proposal was applied to implement a pneumatic crane for
   remote operation based on Digital Twin. The assessment demonstrates
   adequacy in describing implementation activities independently of the
   specific equipment features, indicating an opportunity for extension to
   other cases and situations. Thus, the proposed Digital Twin
   implementation approach can serve as a case reference to support Digital
   Twin dissemination in practice.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires network
   automation, to improve management efficiency and reduce manual
   operations. Zero-touch network is a promising technology for empowering
   network management automation by creating virtualized networks for
   software-based solutions. However, the traditional software-defined
   network (SDN) technology is not suitable for IoT devices, due to its
   massive, heterogeneous, and distributed characteristics. In this paper,
   we introduce digital twin technology (DT) into the IoT, and propose a DT
   modeling method through ontology and knowledge graph technologies, which
   maps IoT elements in the digital space and provides the advantages of
   centralized control, device abstraction, and flexible control of
   management. Then, referring to the conceptual architecture of a
   zero-touch network, a DT-based zero-touch management framework suitable
   for IoT is established. Finally, aiming at specific device management
   and network optimization problems in the IoT, a zero-touch management
   scheme with digital twin technology as the core and intention as the
   driver is proposed, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is
   demonstrated using an example.},

Title = {Digital Twin Framework for Enabling Serial Construction},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Modularized construction with precast concrete elements has many
   advantages, such as shorter construction times, higher quality,
   flexibility, and lower costs. These advantages are mainly due to its
   potential for prefabrication and series production. However, the
   production processes are still craftsmanship, and automation rarely
   occurs. Fundamental to the automation of production is digitization. In
   recent years, the manufacturing industry made significant progress
   through the intelligent networking of components, machines, and
   processes in the introduction of Industry 4.0. A key concept of Industry
   4.0 is the digital twin, which represents both components and machines,
   thus creating a dynamic network in which the participants can
   communicate with each other. So far, BIM and digital twins in
   construction have focused mainly on the structure as a whole and do not
   consider feedback loops from production at the component level. This
   paper proposes a framework for a digital twin for the industrialized
   production of precast concrete elements in series production based on
   the asset administration shell (AAS) from the context of Industry 4.0.
   For this purpose, relevant production processes are identified, and
   their information requirements are derived. Data models and
   corresponding AAS for precast concrete parts will be created for the
   identified processes. The functionalities of the presented digital twin
   are demonstrated using the use case of quality control for a precast
   concrete wall element. The result shows how data can be exchanged with
   the digital twin and used for decision-making.},

Abstract = {Digitisation of the built environment is seen as a significant factor

Abstract = {A smart city digital twin refers to a system designed to digitally
   replicate real-world city objects in a virtual space and implement
   real-time synchronization with the real world, thus helping to solve
   urban problems through various service scenario simulations and data
   analysis processes. In relation to the development of city information
   models for implementing the smart city digital twin, many efforts have
   been made to integrate and utilize BIM-GIS data. However, due to
   problems with the capacity available for storing large amounts of data,
   there are limitations in practical applications because it is sometimes
   difficult to provide numerous realtime services in the era of web
   environments. Therefore, in this study, a lightweighting process for the
   Lightweight Digital Twin System was presented as a method to provide
   various services that a smart city offers based on the digital twin, and
   a lightweighting method was proposed accordingly. The process and method
   were verified through the development of a case application for the case
   of 00 city. It is expected that the Digital Twin System lightweighting
   method proposed in this study will serve as a basis for efficient city
   information processing and contribute to facilitating the provision of
   various smart city-related services.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on calibration and test campaigns of an IoT
   camera-based sensor system to monitor occupancy, as part of an ongoing
   research project aiming at defining a Building Management System (BMS)
   for facility management based on an occupancy-oriented Digital Twin
   (DT). The research project aims to facilitate the optimization of
   building operational stage through advanced monitoring techniques and
   data analytics. The quality of collected data, which are the input for
   analyses and simulations on the DT virtual entity, is critical to ensure
   the quality of the results. Therefore, calibration and test campaigns
   are essential to ensure data quality and efficiency of the IoT sensor
   system. The paper describes the general methodology for the BMS
   definition, and method and results of first stages of the research. The
   preliminary analyses included Indicative Post-Occupancy Evaluations
   (POEs) supported by Building Information Modelling (BIM) to optimize
   sensor system planning. Test campaign are then performed to evaluate
   collected data quality and system efficiency. The method was applied on
   a Department of Politecnico di Milano. The period of the year in which
   tests are performed was critical for lighting conditions. In addition,
   spaces' geometric features and user behavior caused major issues and
   faults in the system.Incorrect boundary definition: areas that are not
   covered by boundaries; thus, they are not monitored},

Title = {Optimizing Facilities Management Through Artificial Intelligence and
   Digital Twin Technology in Mega-Facilities},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mega-facility management has long been inefficient due to manual,
   reactive approaches. Current facility management systems face challenges
   such as fragmented data integration, limited predictive systems, use of
   traditional methods, and lack of knowledge of new technologies, such as
   Building Information Modeling and Artificial Intelligence. This study
   examines the transformative integration of Artificial Intelligence and
   Digital Twin technologies into Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   frameworks using IoT sensors for real-time data collection and
   predictive analytics. Unlike previous research, this study uses case
   studies and simulation models for dynamic data integration and
   scenario-based analyses. Key findings show a significant reduction in
   maintenance costs (25\%) and energy consumption (20\%), as well as
   increased asset utilization and operational efficiency. With an F1-score
   of more than 90\%, the system shows excellent predictive accuracy for
   equipment failures and energy forecasting. Practical applications in
   hospitals and airports demonstrate the developed ability of the platform
   to integrate the Internet of Things and Building Information Modeling
   technologies, shifting facilities management from being reactive to
   proactive. This paper presents a demo platform that integrates BIM with
   Digital Twins to improve the predictive maintenance of HVAC systems,
   equipment, security systems, etc., by recording data from different
   assets, which helps streamline asset management, enhance energy
   efficiency, and support decision-making for the buildings' critical
   systems.},

Abstract = {Facility management is an evolving discipline that has received
   attention from both professionals and researchers in recent years.
   Modern facility management considers various interests related to
   material resources, and among others, social and environmental
   interests. An important opportunity for the improvement of this
   discipline derives from the introduction of Industry 4.0 technologies
   for the management of material resources. In this paper, we shall study
   the problem of industrial facility management, an area with important
   economic implications. Starting from a facility management model for the
   maintenance of industrial assets, we develop a general approach to
   maintenance based on the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems,
   which allows us to reason about the implementation of an effective
   Organisational Facility Management Unit. The objective is the continuous
   improvement of maintenance activities, from which also derives the
   improvement of the production process performance.},

Abstract = {This study introduces DigiWind, an extensible digital twin platform
   specifically designed for the wind energy domain. The research aims to
   identify the fundamental requirements and architectural design for such
   a platform. Functional requirements are identified through a
   requirements engineering process using the use-case methodology.
   Existing digital twin and co-simulation platforms are reviewed, and the
   proposed DigiWind architecture is presented in detail. Three use cases
   are presented to highlight the integration of workflows and simulation
   models in the digital twin process. The DigiWind platform features a
   layered architecture with core implementations such as the template
   service, model assembly service, co-simulation service, and measurement
   data service. These components enable the automation of simulations,
   incorporation of historic measurement data, and data feedback and
   exchange. The platform supports various use cases including
   retrospective evaluation, performance monitoring, and scenario
   simulations. Additionally, a knowledge base and a versioning system
   ensure automation, documentation, and reproducibility of simulation
   results. The platform's openness promotes collaboration among wind
   energy stakeholders and supports standardized models for co-simulation
   using the Functional Mock-up Interface. Overall, DigiWind offers a
   solution for developing, managing, and integrating digital twins in the
   wind energy sector, enhancing wind farm performance and operational
   efficiency.},

Abstract = {Automation is the guiding principle of this new era, and despite the
   problems that humanity faces as a result of automation, technology has
   greatly benefitted people by streamlining challenging jobs across many
   industries. The mining business, where there are frequently unforeseen
   mishaps, is one such industry that requires complete automation. In this
   work, a new simulative processing environment termed DTFL-DF-Digital
   twin federated learning decision forest a digital twin environment that
   is tailored to handle unforeseen fire incidents-is offered as a means of
   avoiding these unplanned catastrophes in the mining industry. Although
   the design presented here is intended for usage in the mining sector, it
   can also be applied to other sectors. The overall technological
   contribution of this study is to guarantee the processing of real-time
   data in order to successfully handle mission-critical operations without
   relying on past data. This is accomplished by adapting the digital
   twin's original design and distributing the processing environment
   within the edge-fog layer. Results analysis in the form of robustness
   analysis, performance evaluation of the classification model, etc.
   provides strong support for the suggested methodology. For handling the
   decentralized training procedure, a brand-new algorithm termed FL-DF is
   put forth in order to speed up classification and prevent any sort of
   catastrophe.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 23},
Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) technology is increasingly recognised for its
   potential to transform the manufacturing industry, particularly in
   assembly automation. By offering real-time insights and optimisation
   capabilities, DTs enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve product
   quality. This paper critically reviews DT-enabled smart factories in
   assembly automation, aiming to evaluate the current state, identify
   common practices, and propose a taxonomy for standardisation. The
   taxonomy outlines key factors in DT-enabled systems, including data
   sources, visualisation, applications, functional outputs, digital
   coupling, and IoT protocols. These classifiers help navigate the complex
   frameworks of DTs, guiding the design and implementation of assembly
   automation systems. Through a comprehensive analysis of 60 key
   publications, the review categorises DT objectives, propositions, and
   implementation technologies, identifying common themes and addressing
   gaps in current research. The findings emphasise the importance of
   integrating DTs with existing systems, ensuring reliability and security
   in data-driven DTs, and pursuing sustainable solutions beyond
   energy-intensive industries. This review not only informs future
   research but also provides a framework to guide industry practices in
   the development of DT-enabled assembly automation systems.},

Title = {A TOOL-BASED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR A DIGITAL TWIN: A CASE STUDY IN A
   HEALTHCARE FACILITY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {107-137},
Abstract = {Changes in the local and global markets are forcing A/E/C/FM
   (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management)
   organizations to deliver more robust and innovative operational BIMs
   (Building Information Models). It is hypothesized that BIMs will
   transform from a static 3D model to a Digital Twin providing a truly
   digital representation of the physical asset or the building it
   represents. This transformation to a dynamic Digital Twin will allow the
   A/E/C/FM industry to visualize, monitor, and optimize operational assets
   and processes to support better inspection and analysis for a more
   efficient facility operations and maintenance. To support the adoption
   and implementation of Digital Twin in A/E/C/FM, the authors have defined
   two clear objectives. First, we discuss requirements for a
   functionality-based canonical architecture to create a digital twin
   followed by proposing two tool-based system architecture options for its
   implementation. Second, we use a case study approach to develop a
   proof-of-concept Digital Twin of an operating room in a healthcare
   facility using Power BI Desktop and Azure Services. The prototype aims
   to monitor room air quality as per INAIL (National Institute for
   Insurance against Accidents at Work) and ISO (International Organization
   for Standards) standards. Multiple sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi 4
   are used to capture real-time data for various air quality parameters
   including temperature, humidity, airflow, particulate contamination, and
   Nitrous Oxide (N2O) gas. Multiple dashboards are also created to
   visualize, monitor, and analyze the data harnessed from the OR sensors.
   The implementation addresses critical issues including security, data
   storage, visualization, processing, data streaming, collection, and
   analysis. As an initial validation, the Digital Twin prototype was
   presented and discussed with a healthcare BIM manager. Initial feedback
   from the industry expert indicated that the prototype could decrease the
   required time to respond to facility maintenance issues such as
   decreased air flow due to possible obstructions.},

Abstract = {Recent advancements in communication technology (CT) have ignited
   significant interest in the cutting-edge concept of the digital twin
   (DT), which holds the potential to revolutionize smart microgrid systems
   (SMGs). This study delves into the concepts and essential steps involved
   in constructing a DT-enabled smart microgrid (DT-SMG), emphasizing the
   necessity for complete automation to enhance device intelligence.
   Additionally, the paper discusses implementation standards for
   automation and the need for further modifications to accommodate future
   applications. The objective is to explore important DT-SMG use cases,
   and discuss the associated problems and potential solutions within
   DT-based automation frameworks. Recognizing the criticality of
   situational awareness, security, and resilience in DT-SMGs, the paper
   conducts a comparative study, highlighting the pros and cons gleaned
   from existing literature. These findings offer readers a comprehensive
   perspective, empowering them to develop and deploy DT technology across
   a spectrum of power system applications. Finally, the paper looks ahead
   to the future horizon of DT-SMGs.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Pages = {32-49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent years, the architecture, engineering, construction, and
   facility management (FM) industries have been applying various emerging
   digital technologies to facilitate the design, construction, and
   management of infrastructure facilities. Digital twin (DT) has emerged
   as a solution for enabling real-time data acquisition, transfer,
   analysis, and utilization for improved decision-making toward smart FM.
   Substantial research on DT for FM has been undertaken in the past
   decade. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the literature on
   DT for FM. A total of 248 research articles are obtained from the Scopus
   and Web of Science databases. VOSviewer is then utilized to conduct
   bibliometric analysis and visualize keyword cooccurrence, citation, and
   co-authorship networks; furthermore, the research topics, authors,
   sources, and countries contributing to the use of DT for FM are
   identified. The findings show that the current research of DT in FM
   focuses on building information modeling-based FM, artificial
   intelligence (AI)-based predictive maintenance, real-time cyber-physical
   system data integration, and facility lifecycle asset management.
   Several areas, such as AI-based real-time asset prognostics and health
   management, virtual-based intelligent infrastructure monitoring, deep
   learning-aided continuous improvement of the FM systems, semantically
   rich data interoperability throughout the facility lifecycle, and
   autonomous control feedback, need to be further studied. This review
   contributes to the body of knowledge on digital transformation and smart
   FM by identifying the landscape, state-of-the-art research trends, and
   future needs with regard to DT in FM.},

Abstract = {The civil engineering industry is notorious for being slow in the
   adoption of digital technology and research has shown that the industry
   suffers from poor asset management processes as a result. Digital Twin
   is one of the emerging technologies being adopted to address this
   challenge. This study conducted a systematic literature review of
   digital twin for asset management using social network analysis. Salient
   topics in studies were identified and centrality metrics including
   degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centralities were used to analyze
   the importance of topics. The analysis involved global analyses of the
   combined studies and local analysis within identified clusters. The
   result showed that some topics such as real-time data and decision
   making have received more attention from scholars. Topics that had low
   centrality scores were also identified as less studied in the research
   space. The study was also able to cross-compare the clusters with the
   global analyses.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Accurate anomaly detection is critical to the early detection of
   potential failures of industrial systems and proactive maintenance
   schedule management. There are some existing challenges to achieve
   efficient and reliable anomaly detection of an automation system: (1)
   transmitting large amounts of data collected from the system to data
   processing components; (2) applying both historical data and real-time
   data for anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel Digital
   Twin-driven anomaly detection framework that enables real-time health
   monitoring of industrial systems and anomaly prediction. Our framework,
   adopting the visionary edge AI or edge intelligence (EI) philosophy,
   provides a feasible approach to ensuring high-performance anomaly
   detection via implementing Digital Twin technologies in a dynamic
   industrial edge/cloud network. Edge-based Digital Twin allows efficient
   data processing by providing computing and storage capabilities on edge
   devices. A proof-ofconcept prototype is developed on a LiBr absorption
   chiller to demonstrate the framework and technologies' feasibility. The
   case study shows that the proposed method can detect anomalies at an

Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {56},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Digital twin is a comprehensive digital equivalent of an object or an
   activity, reflecting the semantic and geometric properties and behaviors
   through virtual models and data. Digital twin and related information
   technologies are widely used in the construction, operation and
   maintenance of infrastructure and facility. Transdisciplinary
   stakeholders are always involved in the long-term and cross-scene
   management of IoT and digital twin-enabled smart infrastructures and
   facilities. The intensive interactions among stakeholders often cause
   conflicts due to the variations in experience, knowledge, and interests.
   Moreover, with the change propagation of digital twins, cyber-physical
   resources can't be efficiently and consistently established, connected,
   and utilized with multi-domain information through selective
   simplification and structured methods. This paper proposes a Ubiquitous
   Digital Twin model for the information management of complex
   infrastructure systems based on Domain-Driven Design. To achieve the
   unified and structured description, six domains are deployed in the
   proposed model with sequential or parallel tuples for shared
   understanding of overall system framework or specific functional
   modules. Three cases of one smart nuclear plant management scenario are
   hierarchically instantiated to evaluate the proposed model.},

   sensor and smart metre networks. In this regard, the concept of digital
   twins for building operation is a recent but promising research area
   concerned with the integration of IoT devices, data-driven modelling,
   monitoring, and optimization. In this work, a digital twin platform is
   presented and implemented, showcasing various applications and real-time
   services for improved operation of buildings. The digital twin platform
   is comprised of three parts: (1) a virtual representation of the
   physical building in the form of ontology-based and data-driven
   component models, (2) a data layer responsible for communication between
   the virtual system and the various measuring devices installed in the
   physical system, and (3) an interactive user interface layer,
   visualizing building performance. The validity and added value of the
   platform are demonstrated in a case study of a university building.},

Title = {As-built BIM reconstruction of piping systems using PipeNet},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {147},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is gradually recognized and promoted
   as the new standard practice in the construction industry as well as the
   built environment. Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing system, as a
   system requiring regular maintenance, takes an important place in the
   building operation and maintenance; its failure can cause significant
   impacts operationally, economically, and even environmentally. As-built
   BIM is needed for efficient BIM-enabled facility management of buildings
   that were built before the existence of BIM or with outdated BIM.
   Modeling of the as-built BIM is currently practiced in a very manual and
   tedious way, requiring a considerable amount of time and effort even for
   a skilled modeler. This paper proposes a solution that re-constructs the
   as-built BIM of piping systems in buildings from LiDAR scanned point
   cloud data automatically. Compared to the existing works, it requires no
   additional data other than the unstructured point cloud with XYZ fields,
   no data preprocessing, and no prior knowledge of the pipe directions or
   dimensions. The solution com-prises two stages. The first is a novel
   deep learning network, PipeNet, that is able to detect pipes regardless
   of the size of the input data and the scale of the target scene, and
   predict the pipe centerline points together with other pipe parameters.
   In the second stage, the pipe model is reconstructed through line
   fitting, refinement, and graph -based connectivity analysis constrained
   by domain knowledge that maximizes the coherence of the piping system
   model. The final output is converted to the Industry Foundation Classes
   format which is neutrally acceptable in the BIM industry. The solution
   is validated on both synthetic and actual scan data, and the results
   demonstrate its robustness, fast speed, and high recognition rate and
   precision. The results are discussed in detail and further improvements
   such as improving the precision of recognition are suggested for future
   works.},

Title = {Methodology for Determining Sustainable Water Consumption Indicators for
   Buildings},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The objective of this study was the definition and determination of
   sustainable water consumption indicators for activity categories, as
   well as the evolution of water consumption in commercial buildings.
   These indicators were determined through statistical analyses using
   Shewhart charts. Within a broader scope, the research proposed a
   methodology to automate sustainable management of water consumption in
   building operation using BIM-IoT-FM integration. The scientific rigor of
   the methodology was based on the precepts of design science research.
   The methods proposed for the construction of functionalities and the
   application of the reference indicators provided an optimized analysis
   of water consumption and the detection of excess consumption and leaks.
   The methodology, implemented in an online prototype, AquaBIM, could
   deliver a significant advance for building management. A conceptual test
   of AquaBIM evaluated the consumption indicators and validated our
   methodology through its application in a commercial building. The
   building consumption analyses showed a potential for approximately 15\%
   savings. In addition, five requirements of the international
   sustainability certification AQUAHQE were met. The results of our
   research provide an innovative approach for the automation of
   sustainable building management and could be expanded to monitor and
   report on the consumption of other critical resources such as
   electricity and gas.},

Abstract = {Informatization and automatization are considered mainstream trends in
   the future architecture-engineeringconstruction/facility management
   (AEC/FM) industry. Building information modeling (BIM) is an effective
   technology to digitize building information, whereas artificial
   intelligence (AI) techniques facilitate automation. It could be
   contributive to focus on how to integrate BIM with AI techniques and
   apply them in actual projects. However, a comprehensive review of
   integrated applications is still lacking. This study reviews BIM-AI
   integrations in the AEC/FM industry by systematic-bibliometric analysis,
   and 183 eligible literature items are adopted. Bibliometric analysis
   reveals time series, journals, keywords co-occurrence, and co-authorship
   of eligible literature. Findings are summarized from perspectives of
   techniques and applications. Three typical integrated modes are
   determined based on the findings. Ultimately, current challenges and
   future directions of the development of BIM-AI integrations are
   proposed. This review contributes to systematically exploring
   applications of BIM-AI integrations in AEC/FM industry and delivers
   valuable development directions for BIM and AI.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This study aimed to ascertain the research status of complexity issues
   in building information modeling (BIM) diffusion and identify future
   research directions in this field. A total of 366 relevant journal
   articles were holistically evaluated. The visualization analysis
   indicated that management aspects, emergent trends (such as green
   building, facility management, and automation), and theme clusters (such
   as interoperability, waste management, laser scanning, stakeholder
   management, and energy efficiency) are shaping BIM research towards
   complexity. Areas such as supply chain, cost, digital twin, and web are
   also essential. The manual qualitative evaluation classified the
   complexity issues in BIM diffusion research into three types
   (complexities of network-based BIM evolution, impact of BIM adoption
   circumstances, and BIM-based complexity reduction for informed decision
   making). It was concluded that BIM has been shifting towards information
   models and systems-based life cycle management, waste control for
   healthy urban environments, and complex data analysis from a big data
   perspective, not only in building projects but also in heritage and
   infrastructure, or at the city scale, for informed decision making and
   automatic responses. Future research should investigate the co-evolution
   between collaborative networks and BIM artefacts and work processes,
   quality improvement of BIM-based complex networks, BIM post-adoption
   behaviors influenced by complex environmental contexts, and BIM-based
   complexity reduction approaches.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {An increasing focus has been placed on clean energy, carbon neutrality,
   carbon footprint monitoring, and adaptation of building information
   modeling (BIM)-based facility management (FM). Hence, there is also a
   growing demand to evaluate and prioritize which BIM applications are the
   most relevant to FM and are the most beneficial in the asset lifecycle,
   particularly in the operations stage. To inform BIM-FM application on
   smart hospital management, this research introduces a one-systems method
   through an interpretive structural model (ISM) to establish a structural
   contextual interrelationship between BIM uses in the operations stages
   of the asset. Through a literature review, this research first
   summarizes facility management functionalities achievable by BIM-FM and
   establishes their pairwise contextual relationship. A structural
   self-interaction matrix (SSIM) is then established, followed by
   partitioning these functionalities into separate levels to form the ISM
   model, while using driving power and dependence to form a MICMAC
   analysis matrix. The finding that the BIM uses ``Environmental
   Monitoring and Building Performance{''} is the foundation that enables
   the other functionalities whilst validating that ad-hoc operations and
   maintenance activities enablement has the highest driving power, and
   automation and robotics have the highest dependency. Among the
   applications, energy monitoring plays a pivotal and transitional role
   with a strong dependency between airflow monitoring and solar
   monitoring, while its performance would directly impact emergency
   responses.},

Title = {Automated facility inspection using robotics and BIM: A knowledge-driven
   approach},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Facility inspection is crucial for ensuring the performance of built
   assets. A traditional inspection, characterized by humans' physical
   presence, is laborious, time-consuming, and becomes difficult to
   implement because of travel restrictions amid the pandemic. This
   laborious practice can potentially be automated by emerging smart
   technologies such as robotics and building information model (BIM).
   However, little has been known on how such automation can be achieved,
   concerning the knowledge-intensive nature of facility inspection. To
   fill the gap, this research aims to develop a knowledge-driven approach
   that can synergize knowledge of diverse sources (e.g., explicit
   knowledge from BIM, and tacit experience in human minds) to allow
   autonomous implementation of facility inspection by robotic agents. At
   the core the approach is an integrated scene-task-agent (iSTA) model
   that formalizes engineering priori in facility management and integrates
   the rich contextual information from BIM. Experiments demonstrated the
   applicability of the approach, which can endow robots with autonomy and
   knowledge to navigate the challenging built environments and deliver
   facility inspection outcomes. The iSTA model is publicized online, in
   hope of further extension by the research community and practical
   deployment to enable automated facility inspection using robotics and
   BIM.},

Abstract = {Digital twins aim to virtually replicate the static and dynamic building
   characteristics through real-time connectivity between virtual and
   physical counterparts. Despite its potential, research into digital
   twins for facility management (FM) in multipurpose spaces is at an early
   stage, especially to control and optimize the various uses and
   configuration layouts. One of the major barriers to the adoption of
   digital twin technology in multipurpose buildings is the lack of
   interoperability, primarily between building information modeling (BIM)
   and Internet of things (IoT) data sources. This paper presents a
   possible digital-twin architecture to enable digital-twin applications
   aiming to impact building performance, acting on the facility management
   of stagecraft and variable acoustic architectural elements to control
   the reverberation time in real time. The case study of Roberto De Silva
   Multipurpose Hall is presented, in which the indoor acoustic quality is
   controlled by the digital twin that returns the reverberation time
   output as a function of stage equipment layouts, variable acoustic
   elements and hall occupancy.},

Title = {Rule-Based Scan-to-BIM Mapping Pipeline in the Plumbing System},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The number of scan-to-BIM projects that convert scanned data into
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) for facility management applications
   in the Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) fields has been
   increasing. This conversion features an application purpose-oriented
   process, so the Scan-to-BIM work parameters to be applied vary in each
   project. Inevitably, a modeler manually adjusts the BIM modeling
   parameters according to the application purpose, and repeats the
   Scan-to-BIM process until the desired result is achieved. This
   repetitive manual process has adverse consequences for project
   productivity and quality. If the Scan-to-BIM process can be formalized
   based on predefined rules, the repetitive process in various cases can
   be automated by re-adjusting only the parameters. In addition, the
   predefined rule-based Scan-to-BIM pipeline can be stored and reused as a
   library. This study proposes a rule-based Scan-to-BIM Mapping Pipeline
   to support application-oriented Scan-to-BIM process automation,
   variability and reusability. The application target of the proposed
   pipeline method is the plumbing system that occupies a large number of
   MEPs. The proposed method was implemented using an automatic generation
   algorithm, and its effectiveness was verified.},

Abstract = {Informed decision-making is crucial for construction site operators.
   Cyber-physical systems, including various technologies such as augmented
   reality and building automation tools, are gathering popularity within
   the infrastructure management sector. However, they are expensive and
   inaccessible to adopt for most small organizations. This paper describes
   a prototype of low-cost mobile augmented reality service for BIM and
   demonstrated its usability for pipe maintenance by supporting
   inspection, workflow management, data reduction, and augmented reality.
   User views about the decision support, integration and ease of use of
   the prototype were also collected from the organisations in the UK and
   South Korea. The results showed that integrating the augmented reality
   service with the building automation tool connected to the BIM server
   enhances decision-making for onsite operations by generating a closed
   loop. This paper also highlights the need for developing low-cost
   digital solutions to foster the digitalization of construction
   organisations with limited budgets.},

Title = {BIM assisted Building Automation System information exchange using
   BACnet and IFC},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {110},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Smart buildings are the trend of the next generation's commercial
   buildings that link different building systems together with the
   Building Automation System (BAS). Building information modeling (BIM)
   assists in data exchange and information flow. Previous research has
   explored BAS and BIM integration for energy management, building design
   optimization and operation, and building fault detection and
   diagnostics. However, it is rarely seen to design BAS or exchange BAS
   information in different project stages using BIM tools. The current
   design of the BAS system is either using 2D drawings based on AutoCAD or
   vendor customized tools. Unlike the other building systems, BAS seldom
   participates in design-build BIM cycle but blends into facility
   management in the later stage. To tackle this issue, this research aims
   to set a fundamental step to facilitate information exchange for BIM
   assisted BAS design and operation using one of the BAS open
   communication protocol named Building Automation and Control Networks
   (BACnet) and open BIM standard Industry Foundation Class (IFC). This
   paper leverages Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and Model View
   Definition (MVD) methodologies to define an IFC subset schema (a BACnet
   MVD) so that BAS information conforming to the BACnet protocol can be
   represented in IFC data model for information exchange throughout
   various project stages with BIM tools. Revit and a web browser were used
   to demonstrate the implementation of the BACnet MVD for BAS information
   exchange. In this way, BAS information represented in the open BIM
   standard can unlock the potential of future smart building information
   exchange and integration.},

Title = {Investigation on Maintenance Technology of Large-Scale Public Venues
   Based on BIM Technology},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Recently, the digital operation and maintenance of large-scale public
   venues have received increasing attention. The traditional building
   automation system (BAS), which can only provide information in a
   non-visualized way, is incapable of meeting the complex requirements of
   modern operation and maintenance. Therefore, a 3D-based building
   information modeling (BIM) technology is needed to improve operation and
   maintenance efficiency. In the paper, a BAS-to-BIM combined strategy is
   introduced, and the BIM-based maintenance object framework for
   large-scale public venues is re-built. The conversion method and
   lightweight method for the BIM maintenance model are introduced and a
   new type of public protocol, which can be used to attain a unified
   protocol layer that serves the BIM model, is proposed. In addition, this
   article presents the application of technologies, such as virtual/mixed
   reality, to improve the convenience of operation and maintenance.
   Finally, a practical project of a snow-sports stadium is given as an
   example to elaborate on the benefit of the proposed method. It indicates
   that the functions, for example, information integration, visualization,
   and positioning, introduced by BIM technology can effectively improve
   the quality and efficiency of project operation and maintenance.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper presents a developed BIMxAR application, an
   integration of building information modeling (BIM) with augmented
   reality (AR) linked with real-time online database to support the
   building facility management work. The primary aim of this research was
   to develop and empirically examine the applicability of a BIM-based AR
   (BIMxAR) application in building facility
   management.Design/methodology/approachThe BIMxAR application was
   developed and experimented with maintenance work of a university
   laboratory building. The experiment consisted of a comparison of
   supportive maintenance tasks performed using the traditional approach
   and the BIMxAR approach by 38 university students. The time taken to
   complete each task was recorded and analyzed using statistical analyses
   to compare the performance between the tasks completed using each
   approach.FindingsThe results indicated that the group using the BIMxAR
   application approach completed the tasks correctly in a significantly
   shorter time compared to that using the traditional approach. The
   findings supported the applicability of the developed BIMxAR application
   and the improvement of the building facility management tasks when using
   the proposed approach.Originality/valueThis paper presents a
   methodological approach in developing a mobile application that
   integrates BIM with AR for facility management work, leveraging
   real-time information exchange through a cloud-based platform. The paper
   also provides empirical evidence that demonstrates how the integration
   between BIM and AR could be achieved and implemented to help facilitate
   building maintenance tasks.},

Title = {UPDATE APPROACHES AND METHODS FOR DIGITAL BUILDING MODELS - LITERATURE
   REVIEW},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {191-222},
Abstract = {A combination of systematic and bibliometric literature review is
   applied. For bibliometric analysis a citation network analysis, keyword
   cluster analysis, burst detection analysis and the total citation score
   are evaluated. So far, literature mainly deals with creation of digital
   building models. However, in the operational phase of a building,
   updating digital building models is essential in order to use the
   digital building models for applications like maintenance, facility
   management and conversion planning. In this paper approaches and methods
   to update digital building data are examined systematically to reflect
   the current state of scientific knowledge. This will identify and
   compare update approaches for digital building models. Nine interrelated
   research areas can be identified that deal with updating digital
   building information. Based on the body of knowledge on the topic
   ``Updating of digital building models{''}, research gaps and poorly
   represented research areas are identified. One gap in research is the
   use of photogrammetry to update individual buildings during their
   operational phase. In addition to strong research areas such as
   geoscience, which has produced update approaches over the years, areas
   like factory planning have been identified which hardly consider
   approaches to updating as-built data. Only the most important and
   largest research areas involved have been considered. A more detailed
   examination would be possible, but would go beyond the scope of this
   paper. This paper is the first to analyse updating approaches in a
   detailed, systematic, and bibliographic manner. The holistic view of the
   topic of updating approaches of digital building models helps to get an
   overview of existing approaches. Especially because in building
   operation up-to-date digital plan documents of the building are
   increasingly needed, this overview is necessary.},

Abstract = {Achieving efficiency success status inside an organization's built
   environment and obtaining a positive return on investments need robust
   and comprehensive asset management and maintenance processes based on
   the efficiency of contract information documents within the built asset
   lifecycle. This paper aims to highlight the appropriate interactive
   approach for construction projects to build the information flow scope
   of asset facility management contracts based on GIS (Geographical
   Information System) and BIM (Building Information Modeling) integration
   processes and sustainability standards, and project as-built contractual
   documents to support owners and stakeholders with the intent of
   improving asset management processes. Expert interviews and contract
   information flow types in several facility management processes
   conducted in both local and international facility management
   organizations were used to assist the information flow scope method. The
   study classified and built significant integrated information and data
   flow models for a case study to serve as contract guidelines, including
   efficiency performance measures and indicators for monitoring
   procedures, technical evaluation, and financial issues in order to
   provide high-performance service quality in facility management

   Practices: A Qualitative Study},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGIES},

Abstract = {The construction industry in Kuwait is experiencing a transformative
   shift with the adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   technologies, particularly BIM 6D for sustainability analysis and 7D for
   facility management. This study investigates the integration of these
   dimensions to address sustainability challenges in Kuwait's construction
   sector, aligning practices with the United Nations' Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). Through qualitative interviews with 15
   stakeholders-including architects, engineers, and contractors-and
   analysis of industry reports, policies, and case studies, the research
   identifies both opportunities for and barriers to BIM adoption. While
   BIM offers significant potential for lifecycle analysis, waste
   reduction, and energy efficiency, its adoption remains limited, with
   only 27\% of construction waste recycled. Challenges include high
   initial costs, a shortage of skilled personnel, and resistance to
   change. The study highlights actionable strategies, including enhanced
   regulatory frameworks, university curriculum integration, and
   professional training programs led by the Kuwait Society of Engineers,
   to address these barriers. It also emphasizes the critical role of
   collaboration among government bodies, industry leaders, and
   institutions like the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research. Drawing
   from successful international BIM projects, the findings offer a
   practical framework for improving sustainability in arid regions,
   positioning Kuwait's experience as a model for other Middle Eastern and
   North African countries. This research underscores the transformative
   role of BIM technologies in advancing global sustainable construction
   practices and achieving a more efficient and eco-friendly future.},

Title = {Implementation of a BIM-FM Platform at an International Airport Project:
   Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Despite that the need to develop an integrated building information
   modeling-facility management (BIM-FM) system is often emphasized in the
   literature, real-life implementation case studies focusing on
   large-scale facilities are scarce. The goal of this paper is to describe
   the capacities of building information modeling (BIM) in the facility
   management (FM) phase by presenting the experience gained during the
   development and utilization of BIM-FM platform at a large-scale facility
   and to illustrate technical challenges and lessons learned from the
   perspective of practitioners. The selected case is an international
   airport facility, in which a BIM-FM platform was implemented and used in
   the FM phase for 4 years. Two data collection methods were used in the
   case study: (1) interviews with the project team; and (2) investigation
   of documents, models, and BIM-FM platform. The main contribution of this
   paper is that it provides qualitative insights on how BIM-FM integration
   was performed in a large-scale project, including BIM-FM platform
   selection and development processes, and identifying the technical
   challenges and lessons learned that were observed through the
   utilization and maintenance of a BIM-FM platform. The findings of the
   case study can be used by the practitioners to effectively adopt BIM in
   the FM phase, and by academics to understand the challenges and to
   develop related approaches. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In recent years, green buildings have gradually become a worldwide
   trend. Compared with traditional buildings, green buildings have
   advanced requirements and standards in their operation and maintenance
   phase. In such a context, some studies proposed that building
   information modeling (BIM) is an effective method to improve green
   buildings' operation and maintenance quality. The aim of this study is
   to perform a comprehensive review of the BIM capabilities in the
   operation and maintenance phase of green buildings through a systematic
   literature review. To achieve this aim, the PRISMA protocol was used to
   perform this systematic review. The whole systematic review was
   conducted between January 2022 and April 2022: 128 articles were
   included. In the process of study, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were
   adopted as bibliographic repositories. Through this study, it can be
   determined that BIM capabilities can be utilized in the facility
   management of the green building in the following aspects: safety and
   emergency management, maintenance and repair, energy management,
   security, retrofit and renovation, space management, and asset
   management. Secondly, these BIM capabilities were discussed, and the
   challenges and shortcomings of BIM capabilities in the operation and
   maintenance phase of green buildings were reviewed. Finally, a
   comprehensive overview of BIM capabilities in the facility management of
   green buildings was developed, and suggestions for future study were
   provided.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of technology worldwide in different ways drives the
   construction sector to take the same path. Smart cities, Digital Twins,
   Building Information Modeling (BIM), and the Internet of Things (IoT)
   are the trends in this way today. Also, integrating Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has
   revolutionized how buildings are designed, constructed, maintained, and
   managed. On the other hand, the complexity, high cost, need for
   expertise, and other things make the maintenance process and facility
   management by human inspections, commercial software, and different
   tools not suitable for the growth of the technology. This paper presents
   a proposal for a workflow of integration between BIM, and an algorithm
   of Maintenance System with IoT and highlights its potential to enhance
   building performance and facility management. The paper explores this
   innovative system's underlying principles, benefits, challenges, and
   implementation strategies. Furthermore, it discusses the implications of
   BIM, and the proposed algorithm of Maintenance System with IoT
   integration on various stakeholders, including building owners, facility
   managers, and occupants by using a case study. The findings collected by
   a questionnaire for some experts emphasize the importance of adopting
   this integrated approach to optimize building operations, improve
   maintenance practices, and create sustainable and intelligent built

Title = {Use of BIM as a Support for Tendering of Facility Management Services},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Basic 3D models of real buildings are mainly used in the design phase,
   when they serve as a visualization of future projects or as a basis for
   the creation of project documentation. However, the possibilities of
   Building Information Modeling are much wider. The paper presents the
   options available during the tendering for the company's support service
   providers within the framework of Building Information Modeling (BIM).
   The principle is based on defining the necessary content of the Building
   Information Modeling, which would enable a smooth transition between the
   implementation and operational phases. At the end of the implementation
   phase, the model should contain information that could be used for the
   needs of the selection process for facility management service
   providers, which, unlike normal construction production, have many of
   their own specificities, but are necessary for the operation of the
   facility. This information must be entered into the model during the
   entire construction process in the form of defined parameters, a defined
   format and the location of these parameters. The purpose of the Building
   Information Modeling should primarily be the optimization of costs
   during the entire life cycle of the construction project, as well as
   better and clearer availability of information and facilitation of
   cooperation between individual participating entities. Therefore, the
   prerequisite for using the Building Information Modeling as the main
   basis for tendering is its high-quality processing, which places high
   demands on all participants in the investment project.},

   manual/automated hybrid was determined to be the best option, especially
   when regular updates are envisioned. The case study produced an enhanced
   BIM model that can be used to support sustainable facility management,
   called here an SFM-enhanced BIM model. An integration workflow is
   proposed for efficiently creating future SFM-enhanced BIM models. A
   focus group of facilities management professionals evaluated the case

Abstract = {Improving management of complex and congested facilities in hospital
   buildings is a potential point for both reducing money spent and
   enhancing quality level of the medical services provided in public
   hospitals of Iran. Although Building Information Modeling (BIM) is
   identified as an effective tool for improving Facility Management (FM),
   use of advantages it offers to the FM processes of hospitals has been
   neglected thus far in the country. To address this issue, this research
   aims to investigate the BIM capabilities and the supporting
   organizational structure of public hospitals in Iran which can help
   improve their FM processes. A comprehensive literature review of
   applicable capabilities of BIM to the FM processes was conducted.
   Hierarchical FM structure of public hospitals in the country was
   recognized through a review of the related regulations. A public
   hospital case was chosen for in-depth recognition of FM process
   operations and validation of the proposed BIM-based improvements. It was
   argued that the use of BIM capabilities could substantially improve the
   FM processes of public hospitals. Reduced duration of FM activities,
   improved facility layouts, enhanced communication and coordination,
   facilitated training, and improved emergency management are some of the
   expected outcomes. (C) 2020 Sharif University of Technology. All rights

Abstract = {The aim of this paper was to provide a Building Information Modeling
   (BIM)-based management system for the Civil Engineering School (ETSICCP)
   at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid with a long-term development
   perspective. A Building Information Modeling (BIM) management system for
   complex infrastructure facilities demands a detailed 3-Dimensional model
   according to future management requirements. In this study, the
   infrastructure of the ETSICCP was modeled on various phases and
   synchronized with not only external educational information but also
   with facility management (FM) parameters. The methodology followed in
   this study ranges from the blank paper to a BIM-based detailed FM system
   oriented to educational scheduling throughout the infrastructure
   providing real time information synchronized with spreadsheets and a 3-D
   model. The result of this paper provides multiples future management
   lines, like COVID-19 BIM-management or synchronization with local public
   transports' applications (mainly metro and bus transport systems),
   through a public accessible Application Programming Interface (API). The
   significance of this research relies on the generation of an information
   and management system, based on a BIM model of a university campus. This
   project was designed for all the agents involved in its operation,
   students, lecturers, and managers. All these agents have a level of
   access appropriate to their needs and functions within the institution.},

Abstract = {Effectively managing inspection and maintenance data in facility
   management remains challenging due to the lack of structured and
   interoperable data representation. This paper explores how the IFC
   schema can be leveraged to standardize inspection, damage, maintenance,
   and maintenance cost data representation. To this end, an IFC-based
   framework was developed to ensure semantic consistency and
   interoperability in the representation of inspection and maintenance
   data. The framework was validated through IFC schema verification and
   semantic evaluation of generated case studies across multiple BIM
   software, demonstrating its applicability for facility management,
   maintenance planning, and asset monitoring of buildings, industrial
   plants, and infrastructure projects. By enabling and standardizing
   structured information exchange, the proposed framework enhances
   decision-making in facility management workflows. Future work should
   focus on extending its application in real-world scenarios, specifically
   through integration with facility management systems and automated data
   acquisition technologies.},

Title = {BIM-based facility management models for existing buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1A},
Pages = {21-37},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is mainly used for the design and
   construction of new buildings. However, one of the main challenges
   facing BIM adoption for existing or old buildings constructed without
   consideration for their modeling is obtaining raw and accurate building
   data and converting it to the BIM model. Based on this challenge, this
   study develops a framework that uses different data capture techniques
   for existing buildings and then transforms this captured data into 3D
   BIM models, through which it can improve its management processes as
   facilities during their service life. Specifically, 3D laser scanning
   techniques were used to capture indoor building data, while drones
   equipped with high-definition cameras (UAV) were used to capture outdoor
   building data such as geometric dimensions, material shapes, surfaces,
   and various shapes. Then, the captured data was converted into a
   high-resolution 3D model. This has verified the accuracy of this
   engineering model by converting the twodimensional engineering plans to
   three-dimensional through the well-known engineering design tools.
   Moreover, the 3D model has been integrated with the Web Based Building
   Management System (BMS) platform. This research framework helps in
   developing engineering facility management processes and modern digital
   transformation processes that aim at speeding up facility management
   during their service period using modern technologies. This study aims
   to develop current knowledge in the construction industry and facility
   management by reviewing a comprehensive understanding of how to use
   modern technologies to obtain various information to develop BIM models
   for existing and nonmodeled buildings in order to exploit and integrate
   them with advanced facility management systems and platforms, which
   constitutes a major progress in this field allowing to save a lot of
   effort and money in the future.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {151},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The facility management (FM) of the metro rail is a complex and
   challenging task due to numerous station facilities, their operational
   interdependencies, and limited historical maintenance data. While there
   have been a few studies on building information modeling (BIM)
   implementation for metro rail projects (MRPs), BIM-enabled FM for MRP
   studies are still limited. This study aims to develop a BIM-enabled FM
   workflow to transform the traditional project delivery process (TPDP)
   into a digital project delivery process (DPDP) for MRP leveraging open
   standards from the Industry Foundation Class (IFC) as a data exchange
   format. The workflow developed was validated using a case study of a
   metro rail station and its application was evaluated. The findings of
   the evaluation highlight that the workflow developed was highly
   applicable for maintenance tracking and document management of station
   facilities. The main contribution of this research is that the workflow
   developed addresses the challenges associated with TPDP, enables digital
   data transfer and interoperability, and enhances facility information
   retrieval and bidirectional communication within the BIM-enabled FM
   platform.},

Abstract = {Facility management platforms are widely used in the facility
   maintenance phase of the building life cycle. However, a large amount of
   complex building information affects facility managers' efficiency and
   user experience in retrieving specific information on the facility
   management platform. Therefore, this research aims to develop a
   conversation-based method to improve the efficiency and user experience
   of facility management information delivery. The proposed method
   contains four major modules: decision mechanism, equipment dataset,
   intent analysis, and knowledge base. A chatbot prototype was developed
   based on the proposed method. The prototype was then validated through a
   feasibility test and field test at the Shulin Arts Comprehensive
   Administration Building in Taiwan. The results showed that the proposed
   method changes the traditional information delivery between users and
   the facility management platform. By integrating natural language
   processing (NLP), building information modelling (BIM), and ontological
   techniques, the proposed method can increase the efficiency of FM
   information retrieval.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Mega-facility management has long been inefficient due to manual,
   reactive approaches. Current facility management systems face challenges
   such as fragmented data integration, limited predictive systems, use of
   traditional methods, and lack of knowledge of new technologies, such as
   Building Information Modeling and Artificial Intelligence. This study
   examines the transformative integration of Artificial Intelligence and
   Digital Twin technologies into Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   frameworks using IoT sensors for real-time data collection and
   predictive analytics. Unlike previous research, this study uses case
   studies and simulation models for dynamic data integration and
   scenario-based analyses. Key findings show a significant reduction in
   maintenance costs (25\%) and energy consumption (20\%), as well as
   increased asset utilization and operational efficiency. With an F1-score
   of more than 90\%, the system shows excellent predictive accuracy for
   equipment failures and energy forecasting. Practical applications in
   hospitals and airports demonstrate the developed ability of the platform
   to integrate the Internet of Things and Building Information Modeling
   technologies, shifting facilities management from being reactive to
   proactive. This paper presents a demo platform that integrates BIM with
   Digital Twins to improve the predictive maintenance of HVAC systems,
   equipment, security systems, etc., by recording data from different
   assets, which helps streamline asset management, enhance energy
   efficiency, and support decision-making for the buildings' critical
   systems.},

Abstract = {Integrating building information modeling (BIM) with Internet of things
   (IoT) technologies significantly enhances facility management (FM) by
   enabling advanced real-time monitoring of indoor environmental quality
   (IEQ). However, technical complexity, proprietary limitations, high
   software costs, and unclear long-term benefits hinder practical
   adoption. This study suggests a way to combine BIM and IoT using open
   standards like IFC and JSON, simple programming tools like Node-RED, and
   secure cloud services. A case study of a six-story office building
   showed that real-time IEQ sensor data can be combined with organized BIM
   information, helping to make better decisions about maintaining,
   replacing, or upgrading heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
   (HVAC) systems. This integration offers essential data needed for using
   advanced analysis techniques, specifically tackling issues with
   compatibility, ease of use, and organizational challenges, which is
   especially advantageous for small-to-medium-sized office buildings.
   Nevertheless, this study faced limitations due to restricted real-time
   data access from existing building management systems and preliminary
   predictive analytic capabilities, highlighting a need for improved
   direct data integration and robust analytical methods in future
   implementations.},

Abstract = {Identifying, tracking, controlling, and managing facilities and the
   associated problems are critical tasks in facility management. In
   addition, the facility maintenance information needs to be constantly
   updated, which leads to an extra workload for staff using paper and
   two-dimensional drawings. To overcome these challenges, a system based
   on building information modeling (BIM) and radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) is developed for managing and maintaining
   facilities. The proposed system simultaneously connects the BIM model
   using industry foundation class (IFC) data structures, the facility
   maintenance database, and the RFID reader and shows the accessible data
   through the internet on a handheld screen. This approach provides a
   general framework for maintenance information management of building
   facilities. The framework invokes the proposed system to be for
   preventive maintenance and the reports based on it. The system is
   implemented in the case study of the building maintenance of a soccer
   stadium to validate the proposed system and demonstrate the system's
   effectiveness for maintenance management.},

Title = {Monetizing Digital Innovation in the AEC Industry: Real Estate Value
   Creation Through BIM and BMS Integration},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {The real estate sector is increasingly recognizing facility management
   (FM) as a key driver of asset value. Among emerging technologies,
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Building Management Systems
   (BMSs) stand out for their potential to enhance FM efficiency by
   integrating design data with building operations across the entire
   lifecycle, from construction to maintenance, performance monitoring, and
   renovation. While their technical applications have been widely studied,
   the financial impact of these tools on FM remains underexplored. This
   paper addresses that gap by estimating the economic value generated by
   implementing BIM and BMS in real estate facility management. Based on
   thirteen semi-structured interviews with professionals from the Italian
   real estate sector, we identified and quantified cost-saving factors and
   challenges related to digital adoption. These cost efficiencies, when
   recurring and quantifiable, can improve net operating income (NOI),
   thereby supporting higher asset valuations under income-based real
   estate appraisal methods. The results show that integrating BIM and BMS
   in facility management may generate average annual cost savings of
   5.81\% relative to asset value, with coordination improvements alone
   accounting for up to 3.28\% per year. Based on a 30-year simulation,
   these savings correspond to a positive Net Present Value (NPV),
   supporting the financial viability of digital FM adoption in real
   estate. This study offers empirical evidence to support investment
   decisions in digital FM technologies and contributes to bridging the gap
   between innovation and financial evaluation in the real estate sector.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes in detail the information requirements for managing
   higher education facilities by building information modeling (BIM). This
   is achieved by conducting a job shadowing quarterly for a year, a
   document content analysis of facility management (FM) documents, expert
   interviews, and a comparative analysis of the FM information obtained
   from two universities each in the US and South Korea. The comparative
   analysis involves mapping the information requirements specified in
   different formats from the construction operations building information
   exchange (COBie) data format. The analysis reveals that although there
   are certain differences between the information required in the US and
   South Korea, most of the FM information requirements (83.4\%, 136 items)
   can still be supported by COBie. The remainder of the unsupported
   information (16.6\%, 27 items) is ignorable because it is associated
   with the information only acquirable during the FM phase and cannot be
   supported by the BIM handover or COBie. This finding increases the
   possibility of mandating COBie as data requirements for higher education
   facilities in extended regions.},

   procedures and costs through BIM tools},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Control and maintenance strategies are essential to preserve and ensure
   an adequate level of safety and func-tionality of civil or historical
   assets. In recent years, digital transformation is promoting new
   operational methods for Facility Management (FM) with the use of
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems. The research proposes a
   method supported by BIM tools to improve maintenance processes in terms
   of efficiency, quality and speed. The method consists of the integration
   of Building Condition Assessment (BCA) with Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) in order to collect, digitize and evaluate the physical
   and performance conditions of assets to improve management and
   maintenance processes. The results show two procedures for data
   collection and integration into the BIM model. The first procedure uses
   mobile devices and Excel spreadsheets as databases imported into the BIM
   model through a Visual Programming Language (VPL). The second procedure
   uses a system of Common Data Environmental (CDE) that capture data from
   on-site monitoring sensors and link them to the BIM model. The case
   studies concern an existing building of historical and cultural value,
   the Brunelleschi's Cloister, and a viaduct belonging to a road
   infrastructure.(c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Facility management (FM) is the costliest stage in the building
   lifecycle of healthcare buildings. Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   has potential solution to enable information management for healthcare
   FM. However, BIM is not used at FM due to its static nature, while
   healthcare FM requires dynamic information handling. The FM systems in
   practice and literature require either implementation of WebGL-HTML5
   applications that necessitates coding knowledge for updates or data
   analysis. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a healthcare FM system
   based on Big Data Analytic (BDA), BIM and Not only SQL (NoSQL) database
   to enable FM information query and FM-KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
   visualization. The proposed system is developed through Design Science
   Research methodology. Findings show that the system is effective and

   Facility Management: An AHP-SWOT Approach},
Journal = {CIVILENG},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {6},

Month = {MAR 18},
Abstract = {Airport facility management requires innovative and coordinated
   techniques due to the infrastructure's complexity, stakeholders'
   diversity, and the necessity of safety. Adopting building information
   management (BIM) as an advanced technology has several benefits,
   including increased productivity, lower cost, and higher quality of
   service. This study seeks to determine the strategies for using BIM in
   airport facility management. In this vein, two questionnaires were
   developed to collect data based on a literature review. The first
   questionnaire was used to collect data for identifying and ranking the
   main criteria, and the second questionnaire was used to identify the
   practical strategies. The experts of this study answered five strengths,
   four weaknesses, five opportunities, and five threats using a
   standardized questionnaire. An integrated AHP-SWOT approach was used to
   identify and examine the practical strategies. Furthermore, a
   sensitivity analysis was used to ensure the results were correct. The
   findings showed that smart maintenance management, with a weight of
   0.363, was the most important strength in the SWOT analysis. Resistance
   to change was the most important weakness, with a weight of 0.455. The
   increasing need for smart airports with a weight of 0.358 was the most
   important opportunity, while cybersecurity issues with a weight of 0.385
   were the most important threat. Integrating BIM into the aviation sector
   can enhance efficiency and sustainability in airport facility management
   while addressing potential opportunities and shared hazards that extend
   beyond airport operations.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Faulty programming of control functions in Building Automation and
   Control Systems (BACS) might result in inefficient building operations.
   To reduce programming errors, an automated implementation process of
   control functions might be a promising solution. Recently, Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) contributes to digitizing building
   construction projects but is rarely used in the planning and
   implementation of control functions in BACS. The control description in
   BIM also remains unclear. Regarding these problems, a control
   documentation method for BIM and an automated control implementation
   approach can simplify control implementation in BACS and hence improve
   the building operation. In the previous work, we developed the MODI
   method for a structured planning process of mode-based control
   algorithms for building energy systems. This method showed the potential
   to support digitized control planning and implementation in BACS. Based
   on this, in this paper, we introduce a documentation method to report
   mode-based control algorithms in the industrial foundation class (IFC),
   enabling data sharing among BIM, and a software-assisted approach to
   automatically generate PLC codes for implementing these algorithms. The
   case study demonstrates the documentation of a desired mode-based
   control strategy for an energy supply network in IFC and the
   implementation of this strategy in a PLC program. In the simulation
   phase, we test the implemented control strategy to verify the
   functionalities of the PLC program. The results prove that mode-based
   control strategies can be fully automatically implemented in a PLC
   program based on IFC data.},

Abstract = {Synthesizing the Internet of Things (IoT) with building information
   modeling (BIM) can improve the performance of the data collection. In
   this regard, BIM endeavors to enable real-time monitoring conditions of
   buildings. This paper is focused on the indoor positioning system (IPS)
   as a key enabling technology for IoT applications, which uses smart and
   non-smart mobile devices (object tags and beacons) with the aim of
   positioning and objects tracking that lead to a smart approach in the
   field of facility management (FM). Hence, we have surveyed the joint use
   of IPS and BIM in FM based on the concept of enterprise BIM (EBIM). EBIM
   forms the basis for the future strategic real estate management using
   virtual models and open standards. As a result, we gained the ability to
   collect positioning data continuously, save them in a BIM database, and
   present them on two-dimensional (2D) maps. This is a part of an ongoing
   study that aims to use data collection effectively for FM as an
   organizational function in large and complex buildings. Hence, for this
   purpose, we have considered St. Olavs Hospital, one of the biggest
   healthcare centers in Norway, as a case study. The effectiveness of data
   collection by IoT devices installed in buildings and how the combination
   of BIM and IoT technology can support a holistic view of the status of
   the buildings, which subsequently can enhance data usage efficiency and
   FM development, will be demonstrated.},

Title = {A Review of the Digital Twin Technology in the AEC-FM Industry},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management
   (AEC-FM) industry is increasingly affected by digital technologies that
   monitor sensor network data and control automation systems. Advances in
   digital technologies like Digital Twin offer a high-level representation
   of buildings and their assets by integrating the physical and digital
   world. This paper examines patterns, gaps, and trends in the AEC-FM
   sector and contributes to digitalization and automation solutions for
   building management. This work covers a broad range of research topics,
   from intelligent information management of complex models to building
   information management and the interaction of building systems, where
   researchers are increasingly interested in using the Digital Twin to
   manage their information and in developing new research lines focused on
   data interchange and the interoperability of building information
   modeling (BIM) and facility management (FM). After a complete
   bibliometric search of several databases and following selection
   criteria, 77 academic publications about the Digital Twin application in
   the AEC-FM industry were labeled and clustered accordingly. This study
   analyzed in detail the concept of key technologies, including ``Digital
   Twin in Facility Lifecycle Management,{''} ``Digital Twin-Information
   Integration Standards,{''} ``Digital Twin-Based Occupants Centric
   Building Design,{''} ``Digital Twin-Based Predictive Maintenance,{''}
   ``Semantic Digital Twin for Facility Maintenance,{''} and ``Digital
   Twin-Based Human Knowledge.{''} The findings show that information
   standardization is the first major hurdle that must be overcome before
   the actual use of Digital Twin can be realized in the AEC-FM industry.
   Based on that, this paper provides a conceptual framework of Digital
   Twin for building management as a starting point for future research.},

Abstract = {The transition towards energy-efficient and sustainable buildings is a
   cornerstone of global efforts to combat climate change. Building
   automation and control systems (BACSs), standardized under EN ISO 52120,
   and the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) have emerged as pivotal tools
   for optimizing energy performance, integrating smart technologies, and
   enhancing building adaptability. This review provides a comprehensive
   analysis of the current research landscape and practical applications of
   these frameworks, focusing on their role in advancing energy efficiency,
   occupant comfort, and environmental sustainability. Key contributions
   include an exploration of challenges in SRI evaluation, considering the
   limitations of simplified methods, the need for long-term validation,
   and gaps in integrating advanced control functions. This study
   emphasizes innovative solutions for adapting SRI assessments to diverse
   building types, climate conditions, and regulatory frameworks.
   Furthermore, it presents original insights into leveraging advanced
   technologies, including Building information modeling (BIM) and digital
   twins (DTs), to refine SRI evaluation methods and optimize BACS designs.
   These findings contribute to the development of sustainable, intelligent
   buildings that align with EU climate goals. The authors conclude by
   highlighting promising directions for future research to further enhance
   smart energy and strategic facility management practices.},

   Integrated Framework in Support of Facility Management (FM)},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Currently, the management of public real estate stocks is one of the
   most challenging activities. In this case, facility management emerges
   as a strategic but complex discipline that requires a great amount of
   integrated and structured data and information of heterogeneous origin
   and nature. Starting from this premise, this paper focuses on how FM
   discipline can be supported by Building Information Modeling (BIM) and
   Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated methodologies and tools
   achieving high levels of effectiveness and efficiency in public building
   stock management. This led to the definition and development of a
   framework that mainly takes advantage of open-source tools (e.g.,
   Quantum Geographic Information System-QGIS, and Dynamo) and
   non-proprietary data exchange formats like the COBie (Construction
   Operations Building Information Exchange) international standard. This
   methodological framework is capable of integrating different but
   strongly complementary tools, data, information, and expert knowledge
   for a multiscale approach. The methodology presented in this paper does
   not provide for an integral transfer of BIM data to the GIS platform but
   leads instead to an effective bidirectional integration between the two
   informative systems, by properly relating them and allowing for an easy
   switch from one system database to the other. The findings of
   experimental applications of the methodological approach to the former
   Macciotta pediatric hospital, a healthcare building owned by the
   University of Cagliari, are presented and discussed. Finally, the
   analysis about potentials and criticalities of the developed
   methodological framework aims to trigger the widest future development
   and dissemination of this research.},

Title = {A New Approach to 3D Facilities Management in Buildings Using GIS and
   BIM Integration: A Case Study Application},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This research seeks to advance the technological process of 3D
   digitization in built environments and streamline management processes
   in the construction sector through digital methodologies. To this end,
   an integration framework is proposed that combines geographic
   information systems (GISs) and building information modeling (BIM)
   digital models, specifically for simulating building facilities
   maintenance management. Although the proposed methodology is applicable
   across various geographical contexts and building typologies, to ensure
   clarity in its development, it was applied to a specific case study. For
   this purpose, a 3D GIS model was created for one of the campuses of the
   University of Cantabria in Santander, Spain, along with a BIM model for
   one of its university buildings. Using these integrated models, facility
   management was simulated within a 3D environment via a computerized
   maintenance management system (CMMS). The findings indicated that GIS
   and BIM digital models could indeed be integrated through
   straightforward linking mechanisms without compromising the efficiency
   of information synchronization and management. When comparing 2D
   facility management approaches with 3D formats, the advantages of 3D
   visualization became clear. This three-dimensional representation
   allowed for a more intuitive understanding of spatial dynamics and
   interactions, facilitating quicker identification of potential issues
   and more efficient maintenance operations. Consequently, integrating
   these advanced digital models not only optimizes operational efficiency
   but also fosters a collaborative environment, fundamentally transforming
   building facilities management.},

Title = {Decoding BIM Challenges in Facility Management Areas: A Stakeholders'
   Perspective},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The adoption of building information modeling (BIM) in the operational
   and maintenance phase remains limited, with many buildings still managed
   through paper-based processes. While BIM has the potential to optimize
   various facility management (FM) areas-such as energy performance,
   security, administration, and space management-most studies only provide
   global analyses of adoption barriers. This study aims to identify and
   analyze area-specific barriers to BIM adoption in FM, highlighting the
   need for tailored integration strategies rather than a one-size-fits-all
   approach. By taking a novel approach, it investigates these barriers and
   demonstrates that BIM implementation cannot be uniformly applied across
   all FM areas. The methodology involves a multi-step process: first, a
   literature review is conducted to identify generic barriers to BIM
   implementation. Subsequently, FM areas are classified to provide a
   structured framework for analysis. Based on this classification, an
   interview structure is developed to gather expert insights on
   area-specific barriers. The research proposes that barriers should be
   assessed based on their impact. While contextual barriers or knowledge
   areas may be addressed through a global approach, ensuring BIM adoption
   across all areas requires consideration of specific characteristics.
   This approach will ultimately facilitate broader implementation in every
   domain.},

Abstract = {The reliable maintenance management system of medical equipment
   influences the patients' treatment and the hospitals' performance.
   Although building information modeling (BIM) technology has evolved the
   construction industry, it does not fully comply with the facility
   management (FM) industry, particularly with repair and maintenance.
   BIM-based FM provides a structured platform to effectively capture
   necessary data during the construction stage for effective facility
   maintenance management (e.g., prioritizing maintenance work orders).
   Despite the design improvements and preventive maintenance plans,
   unplanned failures are inevitable and need quick and appropriate
   reactions. This paper introduces an integrated BIM-based framework for
   effective facility maintenance management. This framework consists of an
   integrated maintenance database for medical equipment, a scheduling
   engine to prioritize and sequence work orders, and a 4D simulation
   module to visualize the work-order handling process semiautomatically.
   Case-based reasoning (CBR) is also employed in the simulation engine to
   capture expert knowledge and facilitate the sequencing process. The
   proposed framework's capabilities are demonstrated by applying and
   validating in a national healthcare facility in Iran.},

Abstract = {Facility Management (FM) has increasingly focused on integrating
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) with the Internet of Things (IoT),
   known as digital twins, in large-scale development projects. Effective
   BIM integration in FM requires improved cooperation among participants
   across various project stages. This digital revolution aims to enhance
   planning, construction, and asset management efficiency, benefiting all
   parties. However, BIM utilization in FM is limited by incomplete owner
   understanding, insufficient data accessibility, and stakeholders'
   unfamiliarity with BIM procedures and standards. Despite recognizing
   BIM's significance, the FM industry faces significant implementation
   challenges. Facility managers often lack a comprehensive understanding
   of BIM's benefits in streamlining operations and enhancing cost
   efficiency, as well as the necessary skills for its use. Addressing
   these barriers requires developing an Employer's Information
   Requirements (EIR) document at a project's outset, providing a strategic
   plan and vision for all involved parties. BIM and IoT are pivotal
   technologies for transitioning to efficient building operations and
   crucial for reducing time, costs, and operational challenges throughout
   any project. This research aims to establish a digital trio workflow,
   integrating BIM, EIR, and IoT to maximize stakeholder benefits. It
   explores how preparing the EIR through stakeholder communication can
   improve design processes, sustainability, efficiency, cost, and time,
   especially for megaprojects.},

Title = {A FRAMEWORK OF ATTRIBUTES FOR AS-BUILT BIM MODELS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {612-634},
Abstract = {Accurate digital twins are crucial in improving facility management.
   However, facility owners often encounter inaccurate digital twins due to
   incorrect as-built Building Information Modeling (BIM) models. By
   understanding the attributes of correct as-built BIM models, it is
   possible to reduce the production of inaccurate digital twins. This
   study aims to establish a framework of attributes for developing
   as-built BIM models. To achieve this, a systematic review of published
   articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) technique was conducted to identify relevant
   attributes for developing as-built BIM models. Next, a comprehensive
   conceptual framework was established for the development of as-built BIM
   models. Through the analysis of 50 articles, nine attributes of as-built
   BIM models were identified and grouped into three categories: data
   quality, data interoperability, and data security. Data quality
   encompasses accuracy, completeness, ease of understanding, coordination,
   consistency, and up-to-date. Data interoperability includes
   accessibility and compatibility, and data security pertains to security.
   The study findings could provide valuable guidance to industry
   practitioners and policymakers in developing strategies for producing
   correct as-built BIM models, ultimately improving the production of
   accurate digital twins and enhancing overall facility management.},

Abstract = {The quality of information flow management has a remarkable effect on
   the entire life cycle of buildings. Manual retrieval of technical
   specifications and features of building components and their performance
   assessment leads to increased cost and time and efficiency reduction,
   especially during the facility management (FM) stage. The introduction
   of building information modeling (BIM) in the construction industry can
   provide a valuable means of improving the organization and exchange of
   information. BIM tools integrate multiple levels of information within a
   single digital model of a building. Nevertheless, the support given by
   BIM to FM is far from being fully effective. Technicians can benefit
   from real-time communication with the data repository whenever the need
   for gathering contextual information and/or updating any data in the
   digital model arises. The framework proposed in this study aims to
   develop a system that supports on-site operations. Information
   requirements have been determined from the analyses of procedures that
   are usually implemented in the building life cycle. These studies set
   the standard for the development of a digital model of a building, which
   will be shared among various actors in charge of FM and accessed via a
   cloud platform. Moreover, mixed reality is proposed to support specific
   information that is relevant to geometric features and procedures to be
   followed by operators. This article presents three use-cases supported
   by the proposed framework. In addition, this research article describes
   the first proof of concept regarding real-time support for FM.},

Abstract = {Purpose Building information modelling (BIM) is a novel technological
   advancement in the built environment. Despite the potentials of BIM, its
   adoption and implementation are undermined in facility management (FM)
   operations. This might be because of limited information on the critical
   success factors (CSFs) that can enhance its adoption. The study aims to
   integrate building information modelling to improve facility management
   operation by adopting fuzzy synthetic approach for evaluating the
   critical success factors. Design/methodology/approach Data for the study
   were sourced from practising and registered facility managers within
   Lagos metropolis, Nigeria. The data collected were analysed using a
   combination of methods which include mean item score, factor analysis
   and fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE). Findings The factor analysis
   results showed that six underlying groups of CSFs would enhance the
   effective adoption of BIM in facility operations. The FSE results showed
   that out of the six groups, the three topmost important CSF grouping
   (CSFG) in the decision rule would enhance the effectiveness of BIM
   adoption for FM operations. Practical implications The result of this
   study provides a credible road map for facility managers, policymakers
   and other stakeholders in FM operations on the CSFs and CSFG required
   for the adoption of BIM. Originality/value Previous studies that aimed
   at integrating BIM into FM are limited. Hence, this study provides a
   broad perspective on the CSF required for BIM adoption and
   implementation in FM operations using the FSE approach.},

Abstract = {Data loss and communication problems may arise especially in complex
   construction projects, which in turn may result in poor project
   performance. Interoperability smooths communication while increasing
   information management quality. The aim of this paper is to investigate
   the interoperability research gaps and trends in Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) for architecture, engineering, construction, operation,
   and facility management (AECO/FM). This study adopted a holistic
   approach with a bibliometric search, a scientometric mapping and
   analysis of interoperability in BIM research. Data about
   interoperability in BIM were collected through an examination of 477
   articles that were selected from the Scopus database. This study
   contributes to the body of knowledge by highlighting the research trend
   and gaps in key areas, and their relationship with interoperability in
   BIM. As results suggest, future studies should focus on interoperability
   in BIM to increase knowledge-integrated, ontology-based, IT-based
   managed, collaborative, automated, well-visualized, and sustainable

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Current railway infrastructure maintenance work, which is mostly carried
   out by visual inspection, has a reactive approach, dissociated
   information, and limited follow-up. On the other hand, railway bridges,
   being critical infrastructures, require effective monitoring and
   maintenance to guarantee their safety and operation over time. The
   designed tool links a parametric BIM model in Revit (R) with an
   automated spreadsheet in MS Excel (R) through visual programming in
   Dynamo, generating BIM/data automation as an initial step towards a
   digital twin. This achieves a bidirectional flow to exchange data on the
   structural condition of elements. The procedure was applied to a railway
   bridge in use for over 100 years, representing its geometry and damage
   information according to technical standards. The value lies in laying
   the foundations for adopting preventive approaches for this key
   infrastructure. The BIM/data automation allows the BIM model to visually
   reflect the condition of the elements, depending on their damage,
   consolidate the inspection information, and generate a visual management
   tool. In conclusion, the designed BIM/data automation improves the
   monitoring of railway bridges compared to traditional methods,
   facilitating the interaction and relationship between the damage records
   and the actual bridge elements, laying the foundations for the
   construction of digital twins.},

Abstract = {Throughout the operation and maintenance (O\&M) stage, facility
   management (FM) teams collect and process data from different sources,
   often needing to be adequately considered when making future decisions.
   This data could feed statistical models based on artificial intelligence
   (AI), thus improving decision-making in FM. Building information
   modeling (BIM) appears in this context, leveraging how data and
   information are systematized, enabling structured information and its
   use. This article addresses the state-of-the-art of using AI techniques
   applied to FM in the BIM context, analyzing articles between 2012 and
   2021 related to this area. It is interesting to note that only from 2018
   onwards, there is a substantial increase in these publications, from
   about 8 publications (2012 to 2017) to 24 publications (2018 to 2021) on
   average. This growth shows the progressive application of the
   optimization methods mentioned above, which opens new opportunities for
   the FM profession. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by
   highlighting the investigated tendency and gaps in critical areas and
   their relationship with the research topic. Noteworthy future directions
   are suggested, directing on (i) data and system integration; (ii)
   predictive models; (iii) automatic as-built/classification; (iv)
   internet of things; (v) energy management; and (vi) augmented/virtual
   reality.},

Title = {Automating construction manufacturing procedures using BIM digital
   objects (BDOs) Case study of knowledge transfer partnership project in
   UK},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {345-377},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to present a novel proof-of-concept framework for
   implementing building information modeling (BIM) Digital Objects (BDO)
   to automate construction product manufacturers' processes and augment
   lean manufacturing.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A mixed interpretivist and post-positivist epistemological lens is
   adopted to pursue the proof-of-concept's development. From an
   operational perspective, a synthesis of literature using interpretivism
   provides the foundation for deductive research inquiry implemented
   within a case study approach. Within the case study, participatory
   action research (PAR) is implemented to test the proof of concept via
   three ``waterfall{''} research phases, namely, literature diagnosis and
   BIM package selection, BDO development and validation and evaluation.
   Findings
   The findings illustrate that a BDO (which represents the digital twin of
   manufacturing products) can augment and drive automation processes and
   workflows for construction product manufacturers within a contractor's
   supply chain. The developed framework illustrates the benefits of a BDO,
   by reducing the number of manufacturing processes to effectively
   eliminate early errors in the model, generates financial savings and
   reduces material wastage.
   Originality/value
   This research provides a seminal case study that implements BDO to
   automate construction product manufacturing processes and demonstrates
   the utilisation of BDO at an operational (vis-a-vis theoretical) level.
   Future research is proposed to implement a longitudinal approach to
   measure and report upon the success (or otherwise) of the proof of
   concept when implemented on fabrications and shop floor procedures.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) produces positive results for the
   construction delivery process. BIM obtains these types of results by
   enabling information interoperability in respect of a building or
   facility throughout its life cycle phases starting at the conceptual
   design, continuing to facility management, and, in particular, dealing
   with contractual challenges for BIM-based construction projects. In
   spite of these compelling contributions by BIM in optimizing
   construction processes, their complexity leaves them still vulnerable to
   risk and uncertainty from unforeseen circumstances. The case study
   presented in this paper has developed insights into the implications of
   enhancing information interoperability by assessing the following
   categories of BIM-based contractual issues: (1) technology
   compatibility, (2) auditing procedures, (3) responsibilities,
   information and communication technology (ICT) protocols, and processes,
   and (4) transfer procedures. Project documents were reviewed followed by
   semistructured interviews with eight relevant project stakeholders to
   enable data triangulation. The set of results obtained was based on
   adopting the hierarchical Jaccard's coefficient cluster analysis that
   then initiated a starting point from which a more comprehensive data
   interpretation was developed. Several new codes emerged from the
   session. Respondents described BIM as a new strategic management
   innovation, and they discussed the need to consider legal aspects when
   devising BIM contracts. The strategies were then consolidated into a
   model data validation conceptual framework as a means of protecting the
   data from loss, corruption, and/or manipulation.},

Abstract = {Relocatable modular buildings (RMBs) are gaining recognition for their
   innovation, efficiency, and sustainability, especially in addressing
   urgent needs during natural disasters or pandemics. Their inherent
   flexibility, mobility, and scalability enable rapid deployment and
   adaptation to changing needs. However, managing multiple modular units
   and their relocation and reconfiguration over time presents significant
   challenges. This paper proposes a digital twin framework that integrates
   building information modeling (BIM), the internet of things (IoT), and
   geographic information systems (GIS) to enhance facility management for
   RMBs. Through a detailed case study of a relocatable modular school
   system, the framework's application is illustrated, showcasing its
   ability to streamline lifecycle management of modular construction, from
   initial design and fabrication to deployment, operation, and
   reconfiguration. The results highlight the potential of digital twin
   technology in fostering more sustainable, efficient, and resilient

Title = {Dynamic Data Feeding into BIM for Facility Management: A Prototype
   Application to a University Building},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) has demonstrated its potential as a
   solution providing support to a series of operations related to facility
   management (FM) through building data retrieval, analysis, and
   processing. However, some challenges to the effective adoption of
   BIM-centred FM information systems occur in their design and
   implementation, causing obstacles to usability. Among these challenges
   are the customization of the information structure for each application
   case, the dynamic character of data supporting building maintenance, and
   the range of FM specialities involved, frequently including persons who
   are not BIM experts. This paper presents a BIM-FM prototype to support
   operations and access updated environmental data for a university
   building. The two contributions of the developed prototype are its
   ability to register two types of dynamic data, namely, the regularly
   acquired environmental sensor information and the sporadic building
   intervention records, and the automation of the data feeding, updating,
   and retrieval processes, allowing a user-friendly environment for both
   BIM experts and non-BIM users. Exploring the BIM interoperability and
   the integration of plug-ins, the proposed solution enables the
   comprehensive registration of dynamic FM-related data in an updated
   model while being accessible to all the specialities involved in the
   building management operations, enhancing its usability as an integrated
   solution for data maintenance and retrieval.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {110},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Extending the application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools
   into the operation and management phases of a building's life cycle is a
   significant advance in recent years. However, few studies have
   investigated or developed tools for the life-cycle management of
   durability performance of built structures leveraging BIM. This gap is
   partly due to (i) the lack of an accessible interface that connects BIM
   software with durability models of built structures, and (ii) no
   available durability models that are fundamental in nature and thus can
   integrate with other tools. To begin addressing this gap, this paper
   presents a framework that uses the Application Programming Interface
   (API) within BIM to integrate physics-based durability performance
   models, which extends the application of BIM into the post-construction
   phases by enabling more accurate predictions of life cycle performance.
   An application of the framework is presented for analysis and management
   of a reinforced concrete structure.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {147},

Abstract = {BIM adoption has accelerated worldwide since it is an important enabling
   technology for digitalisation in the construction industry. Adopting BIM
   requires transforming the traditional building life cycle stages
   (planning, design, construction and facilities management) into
   BIM-integrated project deliveries. Assessing the BIM capabilities of
   these stages helps organisations to identify gaps in their BIM uses and
   improve them. There is a lack of a comprehensive model in the literature
   for assessing the BIM capabilities of individual building life cycle
   stages and their processes. Existing assessment models focus on
   assessing the BIM maturity of construction projects and organisations
   which do not inform the required BIM improvements for individual stages
   and their processes. Hence, we iteratively developed the Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) Capability Assessment REference Model
   (BIM-CAREM) and demonstrated its usability through multiple explanatory
   case studies performed with two international design and engineering
   companies and two general contractors in Turkey. We assessed the BIM
   capabilities of design, construction and facility management processes
   of various buildings i.e. residential, stadiums, hospitals and airports.
   The results showed that the BIM capability levels of design,
   construction and facility management processes vary within and across
   the companies.},

Abstract = {This paper examined the synergistic integration of the Bridge Management
   System (BMS) into Building Information Modeling (BIM), a robust online
   database, and Quick Response (QR) code technology to enhance the
   efficiency and reliability of bridge infrastructure management. The
   integrated framework leveraged BIM's 3D modeling capabilities, a
   comprehensive online database for data storage and retrieval, and QR
   code technology for real-time tracking and monitoring of bridge
   components. Through a systematic review of the literature, a novel
   framework was introduced that streamlines bridge maintenance,
   inspection, and lifecycle management. The potential benefits, including
   improved asset management, predictive maintenance, and cost savings were
   discussed, while implementation challenges and barriers were addressed.
   To verify the developed framework, it was applied to a case study (Sadr
   Bridge). Subsequently, a questionnaire was administered to project
   employees. The survey results demonstrated that the participants
   believed the proposed framework effectively enhanced facility management
   (FM) practices, receiving high ratings across various metrics,
   particularly in budget allocation (4.73 out of 5). Key performance
   indicators (PIs) based on experts' opinions showed significant
   improvements, including a 17\% reduction in maintenance costs, an 8\%
   decrease in inspection overwork, a 23\% reduction in inspection time,
   and a 41\% reduction in paperwork. Overall, the framework substantially
   improved the accuracy and efficiency of FM practices. In conclusion,
   experts believed that the framework was more effective and accurate in
   bridge maintenance compared to traditional bridge management approaches.
   It offered potential for labor savings and budget optimization and can
   significantly reduce inspection time.},

Title = {Development and application of a specification-compliant highway tunnel
   facility management system based on BIM},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {97},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Recent decades have seen a dramatically increasing pace of highway
   tunnel construction in China. The continuous growth of highway tunnels
   creates a challenge to facility management (FM) to ensure a safe and
   reliable operation of the tunnels. The FM is complicated by the poor
   operation environment, long design life, and long geographical
   distribution of the tunnels. This study aims to develop a
   specification-compliant FM system based on Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) using the Lingxia tunnel in Wenzhou, China as a testbed. The
   critical FM information capture, category, integration and transmission
   methods are discussed. The data structure of the responsible personnel,
   process and product for each FM task is developed. The system framework
   is designed to consist of five modules including project documentation,
   personnel and contactors, FM plan and execution, technical performance
   evaluation, and safety and emergency management. The Chinese industry
   specifications for highway tunnels are implemented and interpreted with
   a computer-processable format into the system. This research contributes
   to the body of knowledge by describing one of the first few pilot
   applications of the BIM-based tunnel FM and identifying the challenges
   encountered. The application of the system in the mountainous tunnels in
   China demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of the BIM-based FM
   related to productivity improvement.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Automatic comparison of time-variant BIM models facilitates value-added
   applications during the building life cycle. This paper addresses a
   solution capable of exploring changes between point clouds and BIMs
   (Scan-vs-BIM) or between time-variant BIMs (BIM-vs-BIM). To this end, a
   change component identification (CCI) algorithm is proposed to determine
   changing states, spatial locations, and semantic information of the
   change components. In that, CCI realizes an object-oriented strategy and
   enables exploration of the local geometry of object shape and comparison
   of object similarity without being limited to specific targets.
   Validations demonstrate the effectiveness of CCI, which achieves an
   accuracy of up to 93\% and 80\% in the BIM-vs-BIM and Scan-vs-BIM cases,
   respectively. The proposed method is expected to improve the automation
   level to document construction progress or confirm discrepancies between
   as-is and as-built BIMs.},

Title = {Data-driven predictive maintenance planning framework for MEP components
   based on BIM and IoT using machine learning algorithms},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {112},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Facility managers usually conduct reactive maintenance or preventive
   maintenance strategies in building maintenance management. However,
   there are some limitations that reactive maintenance cannot prevent
   failure, and preventive maintenance cannot predict the future condition
   of MEP components and repair in advance to extend the lifetime of
   facilities. Therefore, this study aims to apply a predictive maintenance
   strategy with advanced technologies to overcome these limitations.
   Building information modeling (BIM) and Internet of Things (IoT) have
   the potential to improve the efficiency of facility maintenance
   management (FMM). Despite the significant efforts that have been made to
   apply BIM and IoT to the architecture, engineering, construction, and
   facility management (AEC/FM) industry, BIM and IoT integration for FMM
   is still at an initial stage. In order to provide a better maintenance
   strategy for building facilities, a data-driven predictive maintenance
   planning framework based on BIM and IoT technologies for FMM was
   developed, consisting of an information layer and an application layer.
   Data collection and data integration among the BIM models, FM system,
   and IoT network are undertaken in the information layer, while the
   application layer contains four modules to achieve predictive
   maintenance, namely: (1) condition monitoring and fault alarming module,
   (2) condition assessment module, (3) condition prediction module, and
   (4) maintenance planning module. Machine learning algorithms, ANN and
   SVM, are used to predict the future condition of MEP components.
   Furthermore, the developed framework was applied in an illustrative
   example to validate the feasibility of the approach. The results show
   that the constantly updated data obtained from the information layer
   together with the machine learning algorithms in the application layer
   can efficiently predict the future condition of MEP components for
   maintenance planning.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND

Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Heritage buildings offer a sense of identity in every country.
   Preserving heritage buildings is important to ensure that bona fide
   aesthetic values are well maintained. However, the conservation and
   preservation of heritage buildings during operation and maintenance
   (O\&M) has been taken lightly which can cause buildings to be abandoned
   due to the tedious work involved for the Facility Managers. Therefore, a
   need for advanced technology, such as Historic Building Information
   Modeling (HBIM), is important to enhance the efficiency of O\&M for
   heritage buildings in Malaysia. Even though BIM has many benefits, yet
   it is not widely adopted in Malaysia especially for heritage buildings.
   Therefore, this research highlights the awareness of BIM for social
   heritage buildings in Kuala Lumpur. Semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with various construction professionals that have experience
   in BIM projects and managing heritage buildings. These interviews prove
   that the current facility management practices for heritage buildings do
   not use advanced technology for upkeep and maintenance, particularly
   when producing dilapidation reports and measured drawings. Findings also
   show the challenges that restrict the implementation of BIM in heritage
   buildings and how to overcome the problems which have been categorized
   into three (3) elements: people, process, and technology. This research
   is expected to fill the gap in the implementation of BIM by supporting
   the initiatives by the Malaysian government for increasing productivity
   in construction projects through the adoption of new technology, like
   BIM, especially for heritage buildings.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe mechanical facilities of large-scale buildings have many
   complexities, so facility management (FM) encounters a massive amount of
   information during the operation, and inspection is not implemented
   efficiently. This study aims to integrate building information modeling
   (BIM), augmented reality (AR) and sensors to mitigate the operation and
   maintenance (O\&M) problems of mechanical facilities by establishing
   intelligent management. Design/methodology/approachThe component-level
   data of an under-construction commercial complex were implemented in a
   3D model in Autodesk Revit and Navisworks. Then, sensors were installed
   in mechanical facilities to provide vital online information for the
   model. Moreover, Unity was used on Vuforia for the AR visualization of
   the devices. FindingsIt was found that FM not only could obtain building
   information but can also visualize the functioning of mechanical
   facilities online through a 3D model in BIM. Thus, in the case of a
   failure, the AR platform is used on tablets, smartphones and smart
   glasses to show the technician how mechanical facilities can be repaired
   and maintained. Originality/valuePrevious studies focused on some
   factors and processes to improve mechanical FM and did not cover the
   entire aspect. However, this method reduces the average maintenance
   time, extends the lives of mechanical devices and prevents unpredicted

Title = {BIM Adoption for Facility Management in Urban Rail Transit: An
   Innovation Diffusion Theory Perspective},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {Although building information modeling (BIM) has demonstrated to be an
   effective tool for the construction of urban rail transit worldwide, it
   has not gained the same popularity in the facility management (FM) of
   urban rail transit. The objective of this study is to investigate the
   BIM application areas for FM in urban rail transit from an innovation
   diffusion theory perspective, in order to gain efficient operation and
   maintenance (O\&M) in urban rail transit. A total of 18 BIM application
   areas were first identified through semistructured interviews. A
   questionnaire survey was then conducted to further quantitatively
   characterize the relative advantage, ease of use, trialability,
   observability, and compatibility of these areas. Statistical analysis of
   the survey results provided evidence that, currently, BIM application
   areas directly related with facilities and equipment are most likely to
   be adopted. Correlation analysis further indicates that the perceived
   innovation diffusion characteristics of these BIM application areas
   significantly correlate with the development level of urban rail transit
   in different regions. The findings contribute to a broadened
   understanding of the complex innovation diffusion process of BIM for FM
   in urban rail transit and provide insights into how BIM can be more
   effectively adopted in the domain.},

Title = {Formalization of Occupant Feedback and Integration with BIM in Office
   Buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Occupant feedback is not effectively used in the facility management
   (FM) phase for operations and maintenance activities as well as retrofit
   and refurbishment investment decisions. One of the reasons is related to
   incomplete or mostly unstructured occupant feedback data. The goal of
   this paper is (1) to formalize occupant feedback in office buildings by
   developing a semantic data model, and (2) to implement the semantic data
   model in a prototype to demonstrate that capturing and storing occupant
   feedback and integrating it with building information modeling (BIM)
   improves the experience of both occupants and FM personnel. Interviews
   were conducted with office occupants and facility managers, and use
   cases were created to develop the semantic data model. This data model
   was implemented in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema and a
   case study was conducted, in which a prototype for collecting occupant
   feedback integrated with BIM was developed to test the proposed
   approach. The applicability, practicability, and usability of the system
   were measured via usability tests that were applied to the occupants and
   FM team members. The findings showed that the proposed semantic data
   model can be utilized to store occupant feedback in a structured manner
   and to integrate this information with BIM-enabled FM systems. This
   approach facilitates (1) continuous collection of occupant feedback
   along with the vital contextual information including geometric data,
   and (2) effective utilization of this information in FM operations by
   providing visualization and analysis capabilities.},

Title = {Enhancing occupants' comfort through BIM-based probabilistic approach},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {123},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite the fact that buildings are designed to meet occupants' needs,
   many do not perform as planned, impacting upon both building performance
   and occupants' comfort. Analyzing occupants' comfort based on
   questionnaire surveys requires specific information and appropriate use
   of visualization techniques to identify possible dissatisfactory
   problems. However, existing studies do not provide a user-friendly
   visualization and are not interoperable with Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) to facilitate the data collection. This paper proposes a
   novel approach for integrating occupants' feedback and an occupants'
   comfort probabilistic model into BIM. It also presents innovative
   techniques to facilitate BIM as a more effective platform for
   visualization to guide decision-makers in addressing building
   operational problems centered on occupants' comfort. Findings from this
   research can assist facility managers and owners in identifying causal
   factors of occupants' discomfort and properly establishing the necessary
   measurements to moderate the negative consequences on occupants and
   thereby improve their comfort.},

Abstract = {The operation and maintenance phases of the buildings, featured by great
   time and cost consumption, always contain a variety of complex issues,
   risks and uncertainties, all of which significantly impact on buildings'

   proposed to effectively manage operation and maintenance tasks, and BIM
   and BIM-related technologies (such as iBMS, sensors and IoT) stand out
   as the best options because of their advantages for the information
   management process. In this research, a literature review on the
   application of BIM and BIM-related technologies for facilities
   management was conducted in order to measure the challenges of such
   technologies' application and potential research directions toward the
   topic. The results pointed out a number of issues in terms of BIM
   enabled facilities management, then discussed on challenges and
   potential research directions on the BIM-FM system for building sector,
   including: (1) improving and managing data input quality, (2)
   identifying frameworks and processes for transferring data between BIM
   and existing operation management systems with the aid of advanced

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) and thermal imaging from drone
   flyovers present innovative opportunities for enhancing building energy
   efficiency. This study examines the integration of BIM models with
   thermal data collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assess

   leveraging BIM's structured data and the concept of the digital twin,
   thermal analysis can be automated to detect thermal bridges and
   inefficiencies, facilitating data-driven decision-making in sustainable
   construction. The paper examines methodologies for combining thermal
   imaging with BIM, including image analysis algorithms and artificial
   intelligence applications. Case studies demonstrate the practical
   implementation of UAV-based thermal data collection and BIM integration
   in an educational facility. The findings highlight the potential for
   optimizing energy efficiency, improving facility management, and
   advancing low-emission building practices. The study also addresses key
   challenges such as data standardization and interoperability, and

Title = {Integration of Building Information Modeling with Sport and Facility:
   Current Status and Future Directions},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Currently, sport is considered an entertainment and leisure industry and
   includes activities such as athletics, water, and skiing. The influence
   of a sport event exceeds the event itself, which indicates the
   importance of a sport facility to the building and construction. A sport
   facility refers to a facility related to the sport industry, mainly
   including not only stadiums, swimming pools, and sport centers, but also
   water parks, ski resorts, and other amusement facilities. At present,
   there is a lack of comprehensive exploration of integrated building
   information modeling (BIM) with sport and facilities and performance of
   applications to help identify potential opportunities to support
   sustainable development. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the
   integration of BIM, sport, and facility by revealing the current
   research status and hotspots in the field, which identifies the
   development lineage and emerging areas of the research and highlights
   the development trends and directions for future research towards
   sustainable development. This paper adopts a quantitative research
   method to investigate the current research status, hotspots, emerging
   areas, development trends, and important directions in the integration
   of BIM, sport, and facilities from macro-quantitative perspectives via
   bibliometric tools, i.e., VOSviewer and CiteSpace software packages. The
   main findings of this paper are that the hot keywords on the integration
   of BIM, sport, and facilities are mainly focused on BIM, facility
   management, framework, management, sport, construction, and design.
   Moreover, over the past 26 years (year 1997 to 2022), hot keywords for
   each year have been revealed through keyword co-occurrence overlay
   visualization analysis and identified in five schemes, i.e., life cycle
   assessment, emerging technology, behavior and sport, health and
   wellbeing, and sustainable built environment. Furthermore, the
   application of deep learning, IoT, and immersive experience technologies
   are current hot topics which could provide more innovative breakthroughs
   for the integration of BIM, sport, and facilities in the future for
   sustainable development.},

Title = {Compatibility of Sustainable Facility Management and Building
   Information Modeling Applications: The Role of Naming Conventions},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {This research focuses on data transfer from Sustainable Facility
   Management (SFM) to Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   applications-specifically BUILDER SMS to Autodesk Revit-where the BIM
   models are created for existing buildings. BIM models were created for
   ten existing buildings to support initial data transfer based on
   different object parameters: (a) alphanumeric identifier (five
   buildings); and (b) name (five buildings). The identifier is randomly
   assigned by BUILDER SMS. The name is derived from the cardinal direction
   for exterior components and room names for interior components. The
   comparison of the methods was accomplished by observing times to ensure
   data compatibility, complete Revit models, and transfer data from
   BUILDER SMS to Revit. The name method was faster regarding data
   compatibility, but no statistical evaluation could be made. The
   identifier method resulted in shorter model completion times, but the
   difference was not statistically significant. It was also faster for
   first-time data transfer, but, again, no statistical evaluation could be
   made. The difference in total effort required by the methods was not
   large. Furthermore, the first data transfer for either method can
   transfer the other parameter, i.e., a name-based data transfer can add
   the identifier to the Revit model and an identifier-based transfer can
   add the name. The name method may be slightly better than the identifier
   method because object names follow an intuitive and logical standard
   naming convention (specified in the SFM application). The process of
   ensuring data compatibility by manually entering object names may be
   less error-prone compared to manually entering alphanumeric identifiers;
   however, that was not demonstrated here as all of the resulting models
   were error-free regarding data transfer. The methods described provide
   useful insights for other SFM/BIM transfer scenarios, such as other
   applications and models generated during the design phase.},

Title = {As-built BIM reconstruction of piping systems using smartphone
   videogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The increasing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the
   construction industry has created a demand for methods to update
   existing facilities with accurate as-built BIM models. While terrestrial
   laser scanners (TLS) are commonly used for indoor surveys due to their
   speed and precision, they face limitations in areas with physical
   constraints like confined spaces and occlusions, with pipes being
   particularly affected. This paper presents a smartphone videogrammetry
   approach designed to enhance the accuracy and completeness of
   terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point clouds for as-built BIM
   reconstruction. The method involves capturing missing areas within the
   TLS point cloud with smartphones and then seamlessly integrating these
   data into a more comprehensive multi-modal point cloud. This approach is
   validated using real scan data and offers convenience through the use of
   readily available and cost-effective smartphones, while its iterative
   nature facilitates progressive BIM reconstruction of pipe structures.
   Additionally, a compatible progressive BIM reconstruction framework is
   outlined, aiming to modernize scan-to-BIM practices in the construction
   industry, with a case study demonstrating its feasibility.},

   Case Study Approach},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Facility lifecycle data captured in BIM during design and construction
   are very valuable for effective facility operations and maintenance.
   Traditionally, model authoring and analysis tools have been used to
   search and query model information. These tools are not well designed to
   search and display needed data and they require a steep learning curve.
   In this paper, the authors propose the use of Power BI dashboards to
   facilitate easy access and display of lifecycle data embedded in the
   model. The implementation and use of dashboards for facility management
   are discussed using a case study. The effectiveness and usability of the
   dashboards are validated using a focus group of six industry experts
   that were first interviewed then asked to complete a questionnaire.
   Feedback from interviews indicated that customized dashboards are
   effective tools to view, analyze and draw insights on data from various
   sources and can improve facility operations and management. Numerical
   results from the PSSUQ using fourteen questions indicated positive
   responses overall with an average score of four or five from the
   majority of respondents. Finally, the authors tested integration of the
   Power BI dashboards with the HoloLens 2 to deliver relevant up-to-date
   facility lifecycle data in near real-time to field staff.},

Abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a next-generation smart
   building management solution, seamlessly bridging traditional Building
   Automation Systems (BAS) with Industry 4.0 innovations such as Building

   architecture integrating BIM, BAS, IoT, AI, and MR for 3D interactive
   building operations, implemented on a typical floor of a high-rise
   office building incorporating its central air conditioning system. The
   DT demonstrated both on-site and remote capabilities, including BIM
   visualization, mapping and navigation, indoor environment monitoring,
   portable HVAC system monitoring and control, and AI-empowered
   optimization. These capabilities represent significant advantages in
   terms of operation management, work efficiency, operator experience and

Title = {Reducing redundancy in large MEP building information models for
   facility management using oriented bounding boxes and hash sets},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {165},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The building information models of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing
   (MEP) systems often contain numerous identical elements, resulting in
   significant data redundancy. Current redundancy-removal techniques often
   involve intricate computational procedures and data conversions, which
   is time-consuming and error-prone. To overcome this limitation, this
   paper introduces an easy but efficient approach for mitigating data
   redundancy in large MEP models by integrating Oriented Bounding Boxes
   (OBB) and Hash sets. To validate its efficacy, 16 actual Revit MEP
   project are used to test the compression capacity and accuracy of the
   method. The results indicate that, using this approach, the sizes of the
   models can be reduced to only 4\% and 33\% of the original Revit and
   lightweight Navisworks counterparts, respectively. Meanwhile, the
   maximum error of the restored model is below 1 mm. This paper not only
   introduces a compression technique for MEP models but also paves the way
   for smoother BIM implementation in facility management.},

Title = {An application of metadata-based image retrieval system for facility
   management},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {For facility management, photography is an efficient and accurate method
   of recording the physical state of infrastructure. However, without an
   effective organizational scheme, the difficulty of retrieving relevant
   photos from historical databases can become overly burdensome for highly
   complex or long-lived assets. To make strategic decisions, it is crucial
   to retrieve the right information from a plurality of sources in a
   timely manner. The main objective of this paper is to present a method
   for organizing and retrieving photos from massive facility management
   photo databases using photo-metadata: photographed location, camera
   perspective, and image semantic content information. Indoor localization
   experiments were performed using Bluetooth technology to infer the
   location information. Perspective is inferred from the device's on-board
   inertial measurement unit (IMU). Image semantic content is inferred
   using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based deep learning
   algorithm. Fusing these three features, seven query options were
   provided for the user when retrieving images. Leveraging Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) as a process and Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS) as a framework, this paper also envisions a federated
   information management by connecting 2D and 3D facility assets with our
   real-world map which can be smoothly bridged with our image retrieval
   system. The realization of the integrated application with BIM and GIS
   is significantly beneficial for the facility management domain by
   advancing the understanding of projects in a broader view with a
   federated data platform. In this research, the framework is illustrated
   with 21 institutional buildings within the University of Texas at
   Austin's main campus, and the authors conclude that the proposed
   metadata-based image retrieval system can ultimately enhance the
   better-informed decision-making process through rapid information
   retrieval.},

Title = {BIM-FM integrated solution resourcing to digital techniques},
Journal = {NEURAL COMPUTING \& APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 2},
Abstract = {The facility management (FM) has been suffering significant changes
   since the introduction of building information modeling (BIM) in the
   Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) sector.
   However, there are still challenges in BIM implementation during the
   building use phase, such as the difficulties related to the
   personalization of the maintenance management information for each case,
   and modeling the as-built conditions. Disclosing building data to all
   the stakeholders involved in the building life cycle is also a
   challenging task. So, this paper aims to present an integrated solution
   for BIM-FM to categorize and prioritize maintenance management, with the
   resource to digital techniques. For this purpose, the methodology
   developed consists of 1-the recognition and preparation of the site
   conditions; 2-Image collection using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV);
   3-Image processing and software comparison; 4-Obtaining point cloud and
   its integration in a BIM software; 5-3D building modeling in Revit
   software, 5-Damage detection through Photogrammetry Point Cloud, and
   6-Placement of building anomalies by means of placeholders. This work
   allows exploring BIM-FM representation and data integration for building
   condition assessment and its representation in a collaborative tool.
   This methodology will enhance the usability of BIM methodology in FM
   since it allows the data update in the model, avoids the information
   loss or fragmentation of the building life cycle and gives access to BIM

Abstract = {With various emerging technologies and integration possibilities, smart
   facility management has gained wide interest in recent years. Several
   technologies were introduced to support facilities management and
   improve decision-making, such as Building Information Modeling (BIM),
   Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Twin (DT), artificial intelligence
   (AI), and blockchain. Yet, facility managers still face challenges
   related to data handling and the actual implementation of these
   technologies. Thus, this paper explores the trends and integration
   possibilities of smart facilities management technologies to provide a
   deeper understanding of the current research state and the areas for
   future exploration. The Scopus database is utilized to collect
   literature data, and a bibliometric analysis is conducted on 7236
   publications of different types, including conference publications,
   articles, reviews, and book chapters, using VOSviewer software. The
   results revealed a noticeable growth in the annual number of
   publications related to this field after 2018. BIM, IoT, and DT were
   seen to share the greatest research attention, with BIM being the
   dominant technology. With recent wide attention, blockchain technology
   is noticed to be introducing many integration possibilities. In
   addition, the prominent contributing authors, countries, and sources to
   this research area are also identified.},

Abstract = {Purpose Current facility management (FM) practices are inefficient and
   ineffective, partially because of missing information and communication
   issues. Information and communications technologies (ICT) are asserted
   to provide a promising solution for managing and operating facilities.
   However, the impact of ICT applications on current FM practices needs to
   be validated and the perception of FM professionals on ICT-based FM
   needs to be understood. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the
   impacts and the perception of ICT application on FM practice and further
   develop an ICT-based integrated framework for smart FM practices.
   Design/methodology/approach To achieve the objective, the research
   starts with reviewing several promising ICT for FM, including building
   information modeling, geographic information systems, unmanned aerial
   vehicle and augmented reality. On this basis, a conceptional framework
   was synthesized in consideration of the benefits of each technology. A
   survey questionnaire to FM professionals was conducted to evaluate the
   proposed framework and identify the challenges of adopting ICT in the FM
   industry. Furthermore, return on investment and strength, weakness,
   opportunities and threats analysis have been used in this paper as
   evaluation methods for ICT industry adoption. Findings The survey
   results are validated by FM professionals for the future engagement of
   the integrated ICT applications. Also, the proposed framework can assist
   the decision-makers to have comprehensive information about facilities
   and systematize the communication among stakeholders. Originality/value
   This research provides an integrated framework for smart FM to improve
   decision-making, capitalizing on the ICT applications. Apart from this,
   the study sheds light on future research endeavors for other ICT
   applications.},

Title = {Smart Facility Management System Based on Open BIM and Augmented Reality
   Technology},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With the wave of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the construction
   industry is also witnessing the application of numerous state-of-the-art
   technologies. Among these, augmented reality (AR) technology has the
   advantage of utilizing existing 3D models and BIM data and is thus an
   area of active research. However, the main area of research to date has
   either been in visualizing information during the design phase, where
   architects and project stakeholders can share viewings, or in confirming
   the required information for construction management through
   visualization during the construction phase. As such, more research is
   required in the application of AR during the facility management (FM)
   phase. Research utilizing BIM in the FM phase, which constitutes the
   longest period during the lifecycle of a building, has been continuously
   carried out but has faced challenges with regard to on-site application.
   The reason for this is that information required for BIM during the
   design, construction and FM phases is different, and the reproduced
   information is vast, so identifying the required BIM data for FM and
   interfacing with other systems is difficult. As a measure to overcome
   this limitation, advanced countries such as the US and UK have developed
   and are using Construction Operations Building information exchange
   (COBie), which is an open-source BIM-based information exchange system.
   In order to effectively convert open-source BIM data to AR data, this
   research defined COBie data for windows and doors, converted them to a
   system and validated that it could actually be applied for on-site FM.
   The results of this system's creation and validation showed that the
   proposed AR-based smart FMS demonstrated faster and easier access to
   information compared with existing 2D blueprint-based FM work, while
   information obtained through AR allowed for immediate, more visual and
   easier means to express the information when integrated with actual
   objects.},

Title = {An Integrated HBIM Framework for the Management of Heritage Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Heritage buildings are subject to severe damage due to their exposure to
   dynamics such as environmental changes, earthquakes, structural loads,
   etc., thus needing a proper maintenance and management system. However,
   during the restoration, maintenance, and management process, heritage
   building practitioners face numerous challenges, such as inefficient
   project management, financial loss, and project delay. These problems
   arise due to a lack of digital documentation and updated information
   management systems. Heritage building management still uses traditional
   management techniques where heritage information is managed using
   multiple format systems by different professionals, thus missing
   collaboration, information integration, and interoperability. Building
   information modeling (BIM) is presented here as a supporting tool to
   address these issues. The aim of this study is to develop a novel HBIM
   framework to manage heritage buildings in an integrated and
   interoperable environment that supports 3D digital documentation to
   conserve a heritage building and facilitate restoration planning and
   facility management (FM) activities. Moreover, we demonstrate FM
   integration with BIM to promote this digital technique. The results
   indicate that the proposed framework is feasible and effective in
   providing information integration and communication between stakeholders
   in managing heritage buildings.},

Volume = {118},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Buildings Automation Systems (BAS) are ubiquitous in contemporary
   buildings, both monitoring building conditions and managing the building
   system control points. At present, these controls are prescriptive and
   predetermined by the design team, rather than responsive to actual
   building performance. These are further limited by prescribed logic,
   possess only rudimentary visualizations, and lack broader system
   integration capabilities. Advances in machine learning, edge analytics,
   data management systems, and Facility Management-enabled Building
   Information Models (FM-BIMs) permit a novel approach: cloud-hosted
   building management. This paper presents an integration technique for
   mapping the data from a building Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network
   to an FM-BIM. The sensor data naming convention and time-series analysis
   strategies integrated into the data structure are discussed and
   presented, including the use of a 3D nested list to permit time-series
   data to be mapped to the FM-BIM and readily visualized. The developed
   approach is presented through a case study describing the scalability of
   the approach to integrate a building BAS system with a BIM. The
   resultant data structure and key visualizations are presented to
   demonstrate the value of this approach, which permits the end user to
   select the desired timeframe for visualization and readily step through

Abstract = {Purpose
   The Nigerian construction industry, like in most emerging economies has
   been slow with technological advances such as building information
   modeling (BIM). More so, the application of BIM among Nigerian
   practitioners is rather limited to architects' usage for schematic
   design and presentation of drawings. The purpose of this study is to
   enhance BIM's uptake, this study explores the drivers for the
   implementation of BIM within the Nigerian construction industry.
   Design/methodology/approach
   An interpretivist epistemological design was adapted to extensively
   manually review and search the literature on BIM implementation drivers.
   Based on 14 drivers for BIM implementation drivers identified, a survey
   questionnaire was used to collect data from the Nigerian construction
   practitioners. The data obtained is then subjected to descriptive,
   inferential statistics and multivariate techniques such as factor
   analysis.
   Findings
   The study, through factor analysis, categorized the 14 drivers to BIM
   implementation into four principal factors. The factors are construction
   related-drivers; process digitalization and economic-related drivers;
   sustainability and efficiency-related drivers; and visualization and
   productivity-related drivers.
   Practical implications
   To effectively adopt BIM in the construction industry, it is necessary
   to identify the BIM implementing drivers, which can act as catalysts of
   change and, thus leading to sustained adoption of BIM. Therefore, the
   identified drivers and categorization of principal factors could provide
   managerial implications for better execution and adoption of BIM, as
   well as the creation of the required change for the BIM implementation.
   Originality/value
   The research provides insights into the implementation drivers of BIM in
   lesser studies in a developing country such as Nigeria. The study
   further contributes to this research sphere by using factor analysis to
   customize and contextualize the drivers that were previously identified.},

Abstract = {Innovation and digitalization are outstanding topics acquiring each day
   more importance for local governments, especially in Facility Management
   sector. Moreover, during the COVID-19 situation, new management needs
   emerged, especially in large public buildings. Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) is considered as one of the emerging technologies used to
   reach a total digitalization of the infrastructure. Nevertheless, BIM
   implementation carries important barriers with itself like, high
   software and hardware investments, initial BIM skills training or low
   data interoperability. The objective of this project is to overpass
   those implementation barriers. For this purpose, the paper shows the
   creation of a BIM-based intelligent platform for infrastructure
   management that leads to the development of a Digital Twin (DT). To show
   the potential of the software developed, a real implementation in the
   Civil Engineering School at Universidad Polite<acute accent>cnica de
   Madrid was carried out, obtaining significant results thanks to the
   actual feedback of infrastructure users and managers. The novelty of
   this project relies on the final results achieved, obtaining a complete
   DT for management functionalities like space reservation, live sensors
   data or assets management. All of it, linking BIM models with own
   software and hardware development using Internet of Things and cloud
   computing. A multidisciplinary work is compiled in this paper, providing
   the reader with the most relevant challenges detected in a real
   digitalization process.},

Title = {Implementation of Facility Management for Port Infrastructure through
   the Use of UAVs, Photogrammetry and BIM},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The maintenance of port infrastructures presents difficulties due to
   their location: an aggressive environment or the variability of the
   waves can cause progressive deterioration. Maritime conditions make
   inspections difficult and, added to the lack of use of efficient tools
   for the management of assets, planning maintenance, important to ensure
   operability throughout the life cycle of port infrastructures, is
   generally not a priority. In view of these challenges, this research
   proposes a methodology for the creation of a port infrastructure asset
   management tool, generated based on the Design Science Research Method
   (DSRM), in line with Building Information Modeling (BIM) and
   digitization trends in the infrastructure sector. The proposal provides
   workflows and recommendations for the survey of port infrastructures
   from UAVs, the reconstruction of digital models by photogrammetry (due
   to scarce technical documentation), and the reconstruction of BIM
   models. Along with this, the bidirectional linking of traditional asset
   management spreadsheets with BIM models is proposed, by visual
   programming, allowing easy visualization of the status and maintenance
   requirements. This methodology was applied to a port infrastructure,
   where the methodology demonstrated the correct functionality of the
   asset management tool, which allows a constant up-dating of information
   regarding the structural state of the elements and the necessary
   maintenance activities.},

Title = {Digital Twin-Enabled Building Information Modeling-Internet of Things
   (BIM-IoT) Framework for Optimizing Indoor Thermal Comfort Using Machine
   Learning},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {As the world moves toward a low-carbon future, a key challenge is
   improving buildings' energy performance while maintaining occupant
   thermal comfort. Emerging digital tools such as the Internet of Things
   (IoT) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) offer significant
   potential, enabling precise monitoring and control of building systems.
   However, integrating these technologies into a unified Digital Twin (DT)
   framework remains underexplored, particularly in relation to thermal
   comfort. Additionally, real-world case studies are limited. This paper
   presents a DT-based system that combines BIM and IoT sensors to monitor
   and control indoor comfort in real time through an easy-to-use web
   platform. By using BIM spatial and geometric data along with real-time
   data from sensors, the system visualizes thermal comfort using a
   simplified Predicted Mean Vote (sPMV) index. Furthermore, it also uses a
   hybrid machine learning model that combines Facebook Prophet and Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the future indoor environmental
   parameters. The framework enables Model Predictive Control (MPC) while
   providing building managers with a scalable tool to collect, analyze,
   visualize, and optimize thermal comfort data in real time.},

Title = {The Role of the Interface and Interface Management in the Optimization
   of BIM Multi-Model Applications: A Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This review targets the BIM interface, the BIM multi-model approach, and
   the role of employing algorithms in BIM optimization to introduce the
   need for automation in the BIM technique, instead of complicating manual
   procedures in order to reduce possible errors. The challenge with
   adopting BIM lies in the limiting ability of computer-aided design (CAD)
   to generate a read-able and straightforward Revit by BIM, requiring the
   homogeneous data format to be generalized better and maintain a super
   data mod. Furthermore, the communication and management inter-face (CMI)
   faces some shortcomings due to limitations in its ability to recognize
   the role of the interface during the project construction phase. This
   review demonstrates several proposals to simplify the interface, in
   order to facilitate better communication amongst participants. The
   industry foundation class (IFC) model requires a new technique to unlock
   the potential future of intelligent buildings using the BIM multi-model
   approach integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Trials conducted
   to enhance the BIM model lack advanced methods for optimizing cost,
   energy consumption, labor, material movement, and the size of layout of
   the project, by utilizing heuristic, metaheuristic, and k-mean
   algorithms. The enhancement of BIM could involve algorithms to achieve
   better productivity, safety, cost, time, and construction frameworks.
   The review shows that some gaps and limitations still exist, especially
   considering the potential link between BIM and building management
   system (BMS) and the level of influence of the BIM-IoT prototype. Future
   work should find the best approach to solve facility management within
   the dynamic model, which is still under investigation.},

Title = {DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARD-BASED INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FACILITY
   MANAGEMENT OF A CANTEEN},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {281-307},
Abstract = {Facility Management (FM) is an essential practice for the operational
   phase of built assets. FM requires a vast range of data arising from
   diverse activities, which demands tools and processes for data
   collection and management. The Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   methodology implies an integrated information management process which
   helps in effective communication and information flow. Therefore,
   adopting BIM to support FM (BIMFM) has become the subject of academic
   and industry interest. When BIM methodology is implemented, information
   models are the main information repository, while information
   requirements set the guidelines for their development. The EN ISO 19650
   series and EN 17412-1 are currently the most recent standards in the
   European context to assist the development of information requirements.
   However, there is still a lack of research on their detailed application
   to realcase scenarios. In this context, the present article cooperates
   with the broad adoption of BIM -FM by presenting the establishment of
   information requirements to inform the development of an information
   model for the ongoing operational phase of a university canteen,
   focusing on developing Exchange Information Requirements (EIR), and
   including other activities of ISO19650's information management process
   to demonstrate the applicability of the requirements. The procedure
   applies the Level of Information Need (EN 17412-1) as the framework for
   defining the extent and granularity of the information requirements, and
   it employs the IFC schema to establish the required alphanumerical
   information. The paper thoroughly discusses the decision -making process
   and its implications, working as a detailed demonstration of the
   standards applied in a case study. The results demonstrate the
   efficiency of the purpose -driven process based on standardization, and
   the information model developed from the requirements is proven to
   deliver the required information accurately. Ultimately, the paper
   results in a robust source for process replication on FM real -case
   scenarios.},

Title = {BIM-Based Digital Twin and XR Devices to Improve Maintenance Procedures
   in Smart Buildings: A Literature Review},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In recent years, the use of digital twins (DT) to improve maintenance
   procedures has increased in various industrial sectors (e.g.,
   manufacturing, energy industry, aerospace) but is more limited in the
   construction industry. However, the operation and maintenance (O\&M)
   phase of a building's life cycle is the most expensive. Smart buildings
   already use BIM (Building Information Modeling) for facility management,
   but they lack the predictive capabilities of DT. On the other hand, the
   use of extended reality (XR) technologies to improve maintenance
   operations has been a major topic of academic research in recent years,
   both through data display and remote collaboration. In this context,
   this paper focuses on reviewing projects using a combination of these
   technologies to improve maintenance operations in smart buildings. This
   review uses a combination of at least three of the terms ``Digital
   Twin{''}, ``Maintenance{''}, ``BIM{''} and ``Extended Reality{''}.
   Results show how a BIM can be used to create a DT and how this DT use
   combined with XR technologies can improve maintenance operations in a
   smart building. This paper also highlights the challenges for the
   correct implementation of a BIM-based DT combined with XR devices. An
   example of use is also proposed using a diagram of the possible
   interactions between the user, the DT and the application framework
   during maintenance operations.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology has been
   increasingly used in the design and construction phases of building
   projects. However, there is still a lack of information regarding the
   implementation and evaluation of BIM during the longest phase of a
   building's lifecycle, which is its operation. More and more often,
   various systems and management methods are being employed for such real
   estate properties. However, these issues primarily concern newly
   constructed objects for which digital BIM documentation was created
   during the design phase. The situation is different for properties that
   have been in operation for an extended period or for those that lack a
   virtual model. Highlighting the benefits of creating and subsequently
   utilizing an existing building model, the authors present a practical
   example of BIM technology implementation in the management of existing
   real estate located within the AGH campus. They particularly emphasize
   the possibility of using readily available tools, which significantly
   enhance the management of the virtual building model without the need
   for modeling skills or complex software operation. For this purpose,
   they propose using an Excel spreadsheet. With the appropriate
   integration with Revit, it allows for the real-time flow of data, making
   it easy to incorporate current changes into the model.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {The importance of facility management (FM) has gradually been recognized
   in the life cycle of a building. Both new and existing buildings require
   a more efficient approach and advanced technology to improve the
   efficiency of the FM. The study is aimed to enhance the facility repair
   process. Thus, the study presents a building information modeling
   (BIM)-based facility repair platform framework, which enables expedited
   reporting for repairs and a comprehensive listing of the status,
   location, and maintenance record facilities. To effectively facilitate
   the FM information transfer among stakeholders, firstly, the study
   presents a facility traceability coding structure for building
   facilities, the proposed platform framework. The proposed facility
   traceability information coding in QR code format can help general users
   and FM personnel identify and locate the specific or abnormal facility
   quickly. Secondly, the study demonstrates that how to apply the proposed
   code in QR code format in the BIM-based facility repair platform with a
   case test. The research findings showed that the proposed method enables
   FM personnel to significantly improve the efficiency of FM, which can
   help FM personnel make preliminary facility repair judgments and
   schedule maintenance plan to track the status of the facility repair
   which can help improve the efficiency of facility management and

Journal = {INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Increasing the service life and durability of structures is an important
   step toward sustainability. Today, the role of carbonation in the
   deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in urban areas is very
   prominent. Conversely, building information modeling (BIM) is an
   innovative tool used for sustainable design, facility management (FM),
   and infrastructure operation. It can provide visual representations of
   damage results that project decision-makers can use for future planning
   to extend the life cycle of structures. This research presents a
   BIM-based framework focusing on the carbonation process and the
   resulting corrosion in rebars. In this framework, by developing several
   plugins, the calculation results of the carbonation and corrosion of the
   rebars in an underground parking structure were transferred to the 3D
   model of the structure. Then, by adding a time dimension to the model,
   4D models and animations were created to visualize the process of
   concrete deterioration. Finally, the calculation results of this
   research and the 4D models can help create a maintenance schedule,
   analyze the time and cost of existing strategies to prevent concrete
   destruction, and provide an integrated plugin used to perform all
   calculations and create animations.},

Title = {Integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) for optimal lifecycle
   management of complex structures},
Journal = {STRUCTURES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {60},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A fundamental issue in the development and engineering industries is the
   efficient management of complex structures during their entire
   lifecycles. Traditional fragmented techniques have been used, and this
   has led to instances of poor communication and subpar performance,
   particularly in the context of repair and restoration initiatives.
   Building information modeling (BIM) emerged as a ground-breaking
   strategy that offers a digital representation of a building's attributes
   and facilitates effective collaboration among several stakeholders. The
   current study examines how BIM impacts complex building management
   throughout the course of a structure's existence. It focuses on how BIM
   helps to advance maintenance procedures, environmental initiatives, and
   project effectiveness. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), structural
   equation modeling (SEM), and literature research are the three phases of
   the study's methodology. A thorough investigation was carried out in
   Pakistan's Rawalpindi and Islamabad region utilizing a quantitative
   technique. The poll of 159 participants produced intriguing findings.
   The process of EFA serves to verify constructs and questions, ensuring
   their reliability and validity. On the other hand, SEM is used to assess
   the structural relationships between variables and their impact on BIM
   based lifecycle management. The findings suggest that the application of
   BIM is favorably influenced by each phase of a project, namely Design,
   Construction, Operation and Maintenance, Renovation and Retrofitting,
   and End-of-Life Decisions. This highlights the need to implement a
   complete BIM strategy across all stages of a project's lifespan, which
   may enhance facility management, decrease expenses, and promote
   sustainability. The results of this study have significant consequences
   for professionals and politicians, highlighting the crucial need to
   provide incentives and regulations to promote the use of BIM in building
   projects.},

Title = {The Concept of Enterprise BIM: Current Research Practice and Future
   Trends},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {42265-42290},
Abstract = {The construction industry lacks a comprehensive and holistic way of
   utilizing Building Information Modeling (BIM) throughout a building's
   life-cycle, where the transition to Asset Management (AM) and Facility
   Management (FM) is particularly lacking. Enterprise BIM (EBIM) is an
   emerging, unexplored, holistic organizational concept that is designed
   to support and optimize business management throughout the entire
   life-cycles of buildings and infrastructure. However, current
   understanding and implementation of EBIM is rare. To fix this gap in
   knowledge, this paper defines the EBIM concept and assesses associated
   perspectives from research and practice in order to integrate BIM more
   strongly into the enterprise's core processes and other needs at
   different levels within the organization and externally. To achieve a
   higher and more efficient utilization of building data, however, EBIMs
   need to develop a clear life-cycle-based information management
   strategy, including coordination and communication between all
   stakeholders. The paper highlights and discusses the importance of both
   available and missing standards related to the effective implementation
   of EBIM. Several existing open standards have been identified to help
   strengthen the EBIM concept. The paper identifies a need to develop
   standards to integrate BIM and IoT (the Internet of Things) and
   standards that can handle both structured and unstructured data. The
   authors have conducted a wide-ranging review of research, practice and
   existing standards and considers today's potential for using EBIM, as
   well as discusses existing challenges and future research needs.
   Furthermore, the EBIM concept is contextualized by providing a case
   study with focus on cleaning. This study identifies a need to develop
   best practices in interdisciplinary collaborative projects. Such
   practical implementation requires integrated and standardized
   information and technology management and the exploitation of the
   available technologies in interdisciplinary interaction with those
   involved in the various processes and the flow of information throughout
   the life-cycle.},

Title = {Building information modeling (BIM) implementation and construction
   project success in Malaysian construction industry: mediating role of
   project control},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 10},
Abstract = {PurposeThe primary objective of this study is to analyze the correlation
   between the application of building information modeling (BIM), the
   construction project success (CPS) and project control. Additionally,
   this research aims to explore the potential mediating effect of project
   control on the link between BIM and construction project success in the
   Malaysian construction industry.Design/methodology/approachThe present
   study employs a quantitative research methodology and adheres to a
   positivist research philosophy in order to examine the influence of BIM
   implementation on the CPS and project control within the Malaysian
   construction sector. The data were collected by structured questionnaire
   survey from 200 respondents using a purposive sampling strategy, and the
   results were analyzed by using partial least square (PLS)-structural
   equation modeling (SEM). The study's findings are all the more
   noteworthy since, despite the small sample size, 218 persons genuinely
   participated thanks to the purposive sampling approach.FindingsThe
   findings of this study indicate that there are notable and positive
   associations between various variables related to the implementation of
   BIM. These variables include accurate quantities and estimations, risk
   management, facility management integration, optimized resource
   allocation and real-time monitoring. Furthermore, these relationships
   are observed to have a significant impact on both CPS and project
   control. The study revealed that project control serves as a mediator in
   the relationship between the deployment of BIM and the CPS in the
   Malaysian construction sector, with the exception of its influence on
   risk management.Originality/valueThe originality of this research
   consists in examining the mediating function of project control in the
   relationship between BIM implementation and CPS. This study contributes
   to the existing knowledge by enhancing our understanding of the
   processes via which BIM positively influences project outcomes.},

Title = {User-Centric BIM-Based Framework for HVAC Root-Cause Detection},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the building operation phase, the Heating, Ventilation, and
   Air-Conditioning (HVAC) equipment are the main contributors to excessive
   energy consumption unless proper design and maintenance is carried out.
   Moreover, HVAC problems might have an impact on occupants' discomfort in
   thermal comfort. Hence, the identification of the root cause of HVAC
   problems is imperative for facility managers to plan preventive and
   corrective maintenance actions. However, due to the complex interaction
   between various equipment and the lack of data integration among
   Facility Management (FM) systems, they fail to provide necessary
   information to identify the root cause of HVAC problems. Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) is a potential solution for maintenance
   activities to address the challenges of information reliability and
   interoperability. Therefore, this paper presents a novel conceptual
   model and user-centric framework to determine the causes of HVAC
   problems implemented in BIM for its visualization. CMMS and BMS data
   were integrated into BIM and utilized by the framework to analyze the
   root cause of HVAC problems. A case study in a university building was
   used to demonstrate the applicability of the approach. This framework
   assists the FM team to determine the most probable cause of an HVAC
   problem, reducing the time to detect equipment faults, and providing
   potential actions to solve them.},

Title = {A BIM-enabled digital twin framework for real-time indoor environment
   monitoring and visualization by integrating autonomous robotics,
   LiDAR-based 3D mobile mapping, IoT sensing, and indoor positioning
   technologies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Existing indoor environment monitoring methods often fall short due to
   the lack of using standardized evaluation methods, missing spatial
   information, or the absence of user-friendly visualization interfaces.
   To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel digital twin
   framework for real-time indoor environment monitoring and visualization
   by integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things,
   autonomous robot-based mobile mapping and sensing, and indoor
   positioning technologies. The goal is to autonomously monitor indoor
   environmental conditions and provide real-time visualization using a
   standardized assessment index with estimated spatial information in BIM
   software. The proposed framework was demonstrated and validated in two
   indoor scenarios for air quality monitoring and visualizationrelated
   applications. Implementation results revealed that: the framework
   effectively captured spatial characteristics of air quality in small and
   medium-sized indoor spaces and intuitively visualized it using a BIM
   digital twin model; and, the ultra-wideband-based indoor positioning
   system achieved a nearly centimeter-level positioning precision.
   Practical interpretations of the results demonstrated that the proposed
   framework can not only detect and localize the potential sources of air
   pollutants but can also identify the possible causes of low indoor air
   quality. This study ultimately contributes to the body of knowledge by
   offering a novel and generic digital twin framework that seamlessly
   bridges various popular yet previously isolated technologies for better
   informing building facility management-related decisions. This paper is
   the first research work that integrates several emerging technologies
   (i.e., BIM, digital twins, IoT sensing, indoor
   localization/positioning/tracking, and robotics) for advancing real-time
   monitoring and visualization of indoor environmental conditions. While
   the proposed framework was applied for indoor air quality monitoring, it
   could be extended and used for various indoor environmental assessment
   and visualization-related applications.},

Abstract = {PurposeBlockchain is a developing technology that affects numerous
   industries, including facility management (FM). Many barriers are
   associated with adopting blockchain-enabled building information
   modeling (BEBIM) in FM. This research aims to identify and prioritize
   the barriers to adopting BEBIM in FM.Design/methodology/approachTo
   address the knowledge gap, this study employs a two-phase methodology
   for evaluating the barriers to adopting BEBIM in FM. The first phase
   involves a comprehensive literature review identifying 14 barriers to
   BEBIM adoption. Using a Delphi approach, the identified barriers were
   categorized into 6 groups and finalized by 11 experts, adding 3 more
   barriers to the list. The best-worst method (BWM) determines the
   priority weights of identified barriers and sub-barriers in the second
   phase.FindingsThis study reveals that adopting BEBIM for FM in India
   faces significant hurdles. The most critical barriers are ``limited
   collaboration{''} and ``communication among stakeholders,{''} ``legal
   constraints in certain jurisdictions{''} and ``challenges in
   establishing trust and governance models.{''} To mitigate these
   barriers, stakeholders should foster collaboration and communication,
   develop efficient blockchain technology (BT) and establish a trust and
   governance model.Practical implicationsThis work underscores the
   importance of formulating effective strategies to overcome the
   identified barriers and emphasizes implications that can assist
   policymakers and industry stakeholders in achieving successful BEBIM
   adoption for improved FM practice.Originality/valueThe study provides
   valuable insights for policymakers, construction industry stakeholders
   and facility managers interested in leveraging this technology to
   improve the efficiency and effectiveness of FM practice in India.},

Title = {BIM-based repair and maintenance for hospital work order management},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Work order management in hospitals that are dynamic and high-pressured
   environments is a significant challenge. Healthcare Repair and
   Maintenance (R\&M) managers need to plan work orders precisely, quickly,
   and cost-effectively according to technical and administrative aspects
   and resource limitations. This paper develops a new framework to
   optimize R\&M schedules in hospitals by minimizing direct and indirect
   costs (personnel, travel, and delay costs), considering managers'
   preferences and constraints. The proposed framework integrates Building
   Information Modeling (BIM), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Discrete Event
   Simulation (DES) to discover the optimum plan for R\&M tasks and employs
   BIM and Augmented Reality (AR) to support on-site activities by
   navigating and retrieving information. The proposed framework enables
   healthcare managers to reduce the time and costs of R\&M plans and
   utilize personnel more efficiently. Implementing this system on an
   actual case study proves its capabilities in basing a good foundation to
   provide personnel's visualized work packages automatically.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},

Volume = {166},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper comprehensively addresses the life cycle of the building,
   from data requirement and verification to its storage, integrating
   construction, warranty, and maintenance management within BIM
   interoperability. Facilitating information management and making it
   available for the operation and maintenance phase enables the flow of
   information exchange between stakeholders. The benefits obtained from
   addressing these BIM interoperability issues are demonstrated with an
   example of an actual project. The most significant contribution of this
   article is the creation of a structure that addresses the life cycle of
   the building. The system allows the use of geometric and non-geometric
   information to enhance visual alerts along the flow of information
   exchange between stakeholders for small projects and residential
   buildings since it does not tackle space planning management. Among the
   contributions, the information flow has been detailed for the correct
   process functioning, and a suggested flowchart for project development
   emphasizes facilities management.},

Title = {Digital-Twin-Based Fire Safety Management Framework for Smart Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In recent years, the implementation of digital twin (DT) technology has
   gained significant attention in various industries. However, the fire
   safety management (FSM) sector has been relatively slow in adopting this
   technology compared to other major industries. Therefore, this study
   aims to explore the limitations, opportunities, and challenges
   associated with adopting DT technology in the FSM sector and further
   develop a DT-based FSM framework towards smart facility management (FM).
   To achieve this objective, this research started by reviewing several
   promising DTs for FSM, including building information modeling (BIM),
   the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and
   augmented reality (AR). On this basis, a conceptual framework was
   synthesized in consideration of the benefits of each technology. A
   questionnaire was conducted for FM professionals to evaluate the
   proposed framework and identify the challenges of adopting DT in the FSM
   sector. The survey results reveal that the proposed framework can assist
   decision makers in obtaining comprehensive information about facilities'
   communication among stakeholders. The survey results validate the
   potential of the adoption of DTs toward smart FM practices in FSM. The
   survey results provide insights into the perception of DT technology
   among FM practitioners and identify the current state of DT technology
   in the FSM sector, its expected benefits, and its potential challenges.
   The main barriers to adopting DTs in FSM are a lack of knowledge about
   DTs, their initial costs, user acceptance, difficulties in systems
   integration, education training costs, a lack of competence, development
   complexity, difficulties in data management, and a lack of trust in data
   security.},

Title = {RATEWORKSPACE: BIM INTEGRATED POST-OCCUPANCY EVALUATION SYSTEM FOR
   OFFICE BUILDINGS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Abstract = {The feedback obtained from occupants regarding their comfort needs and
   performance of buildings is critical for assessing occupant
   satisfaction, identifying the operation and maintenance (O\&M) issues in
   time and for improving resource efficiency in buildings. Current
   facility management (FM) systems and occupant feedback collection
   practices, however, have limitations in supporting effective
   decision-making in FM, as they lack the necessary contextual data
   related to the occupant feedback (e.g., building geometry, systems,
   elements). Building Information Modeling (BIM)-enabled FM systems are
   used for combining different types of FM information with building
   models; however, occupant feedback is still not effectively utilized in
   FM since it is not integrated with BIM. In this study, a BIM integrated
   post-occupancy evaluation system prototype is developed for: (1)
   collecting occupant feedback along with the contextual information
   related to the feedback items in a structured way, and (2) presenting
   this information as integrated with BIM to the facility managers. This
   enables conducting spatio-temporal queries and supports effective
   decision-making by visualizing the collected feedback. The prototype was
   designed by using qualitative shadowing with FM teams to identify
   information needs and use case analysis to determine how contextual data
   integrated with BIM could be collected from office occupants who are
   non-technical persons with limited information on building models. This
   paper identifies the FM query categories that are required to process
   the occupant feedback and describes the RateWorkSpace prototype
   developed for office buildings. The deployment of the prototype in a
   real-world office demonstrates that the proposed system is applicable,
   practical, usable, and that real-time building performance data can be
   both collected and analysed with the developed system. This has the
   potential to increase the effectiveness of the FM and O\&M processes,
   and help to create office spaces with optimized energy use and occupant
   comfort that also supports occupant well-being and productivity.},

Title = {Development of quality improvement procedures and tools for facility
   management BIM},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite the potentially significant benefits that Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) can offer during a facility's operation and maintenance
   (O\&M) phase, the construction industry has thus far mainly implemented
   BIM in the design and construction phases. This is because even though
   as-built BIM models are delivered at the handover stage, owners and
   operators rarely have the expertise to efficiently use and update them.
   Additionally, industry standards do not provide precise guidelines on
   aspects such as the ease of use, interoperability, and maintainability
   of FM-BIM, that could ensure their efficient and effective utilization.
   Moreover, given that these models are mainly developed for the design
   and construction phases, they usually contain design and construction
   details that are not useful for the building's operation and maintenance
   or lack information required for this phase. Thus, this paper
   investigates correspondences between as-built models and O\&M
   requirements, using procedures and semi-automated tools to facilitate
   quality management activities for FM-BIM. To achieve this, a detailed
   checklist of items that are required in the BIM models at the handover
   stage and of the items that can be purged was created. This checklist is
   part of an overall quality framework that includes quality assurance and
   quality control tasks to deliver useable models for the operation and

Title = {BIM-FM INTEGRATION THROUGH OPENBIM: SOLUTIONS FOR INTEROPERABILITY
   TOWARDS EFFICIENT OPERATIONS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {30},
Abstract = {Facility Management (FM) faces ongoing challenges related to data
   interoperability and information loss during the transition from
   construction to operation phases, compromising asset management
   efficiency. Although Building Information Modeling (BIM) can optimize
   the flow of information exchange by offering a single, centralized
   model, the lack of standardization and interoperability issues between
   BIM and FM limit the full exploitation of its advantages. This study
   aims to develop a solution that integrates BIM and FM, using open
   standards like IFC to mitigate data loss and ensure continuous updates
   of BIM models throughout the construction and commissioning phases. The
   proposal aims to provide the facilities team with a BIM model containing
   the minimum necessary and reliable common information for the start of
   operations. The methodology adopted is based on Design Science Research
   (DSR) and includes the development of an artefact composed of four
   components: (1) a compendium of minimum common information requirements
   for various assets, (2) a web platform for continuous management of this
   information, (3) a Representational State Transfer API (Application
   Programming Interface) that ensures interoperability between different
   systems, and (4) an add-on for the Blender system, utilizing Bonsai
   (previously known as BlenderBIM) as the IFC modeler, which guarantees
   bidirectional data exchange between the web platform and BIM models,
   ensuring continuous verification and updating. The results show that the
   proposed artifacts are effective in mitigating interoperability
   difficulties, centralizing critical information, and continuously
   verifying data. The use of IFC promoted greater flexibility and
   standardization, resulting in more efficient and integrated asset
   management. The proposed solution offered a practical and sustainable
   approach for the construction industry, significantly contributing to
   the improvement of operational processes and information management
   throughout the asset lifecycle by decoupling from the limitations
   imposed by proprietary software.},

Abstract = {For several decades now, the construction industry is suffering from low
   productivity, especially in comparison to manufacturing industries which
   have succeeded to benefit from digitalization of their processes.
   Furthermore, scarceness of qualified workforce is expected in the near
   future. Construction automation is introduced as a solution to these
   challenges. The capabilities of construction robots are improving at an
   accelerated pace. They are starting to be used in non-laboratory
   contexts for automating processes ranging from infrastructure inspection
   to digital fabrication. One fundamental requirement of employing robots
   in construction is their autonomous positioning. Building information
   modelling (BIM) and geographic information system (GIS) are now a
   necessity for the construction projects. Integration between BIM and GIS
   provides holistic digital representation of the built environment that
   robots could potentially utilize for positioning purposes. Preceding
   this research, a number of reviews have been conducted on BIM-GIS
   integration, but none studied it from automation perspective. This
   research addresses this deficiency through a systematic literature
   review of the state-of-the-art on BIM-GIS integration with the purpose
   of robot positioning and navigation on construction sites. Using
   software tools and ``science-mapping{''} methods, 236 papers were
   explored. Trends, challenges, potentials, and deficiencies identified
   and mapped. Citation patterns of journal articles along with the
   analysis of studies; visualized and analyzed. Bibliometric analysis is
   followed by a thorough qualitative analysis of the articles identified
   by the systematic methodology indicating limitations of current studies
   such as vertical navigation, inaccuracy, dynamics of construction sites,
   indoor-outdoor navigation. Requirements for robot positioning using
   BIM-GIS integration are defined.},

Title = {Residential Real Estate Valuation Framework Based on Life Cycle Cost by
   Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Real estate markets are ideal investment options that lead to the
   construction industry's and the economy's growth. Therefore, having
   appropriate investment and valuation strategies is a critical success
   factor. Most established valuation methods emphasize market value and
   economic factors and are ignorant about buildings' technical and
   structural attributes. Therefore, due to the process ambiguity and lack
   of information access, the estimated price usually differs from the real
   property value. In this research, a revised valuation framework is
   proposed based on the life cycle cost (LCC) of residential properties,
   focusing on the operation phase. LCC consists of all costs related to an
   asset during different phases of its lifecycle, and it helps determine
   the net present value of the property. For systematically storing and
   analyzing technical and financial information, building information
   modeling (BIM) was proposed. Despite being widely used in the design and
   construction phases, its application and competitive advantage to real
   estate developers and managers during the operation phase are not
   transparent. This research benefitted from the 5D BIM model with a level
   of development (LOD) of 300 to increase the transparency and validity of
   valuation. An 18.25\% difference between the calculated price of two
   case studies in Tehran and their inflated market prices proved this
   assertion. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {To maintain underground utilities in a safe condition, the need for a
   comprehensive management and maintenance system is becoming more
   prominent. There are several problems with the current operation
   maintenance applications in underground utilities, including the lack of
   a digitalized 3D model with a comprehensive database for dynamically
   editing data on the site. This research proposes a pipeline operation
   and maintenance management system (POMMS) by employing building
   information modeling (BIM), geographic information system (GIS), and
   augmented reality (AR) and integrating various project information
   sources through application programming interface (API) and cloud
   database. This system can facilitate decision-making by more realistic
   3D visualizations, enhanced integration of construction, geographic and
   inspection information, and efficient data retrieval. The proposed
   system is applied to an actual project to validate its efficiency. In
   this research, two scenarios and one survey were conducted to
   investigate the performance of POMMS. The case study and survey results
   indicates POMMS's efficiency in improving data collection, communication
   among stakeholders, and perception of as-built subsurface utility map
   while unfolding several crucial challenges and limitations of real-world
   implementation of the system.},

Title = {Development of an Innovative Seat Reservation System for University
   Buildings Based on BIM Technology},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The usefulness of building information modeling (BIM) for facilities
   management, although widely demonstrated, has not been extended to use
   management in university spaces. In public facilities with free access,
   it is uncommon to be able to check the availability of seats, which
   causes capacity problems. In addition, while several studies show that
   the use of BIM makes the graphic communication of useful information
   about buildings more attractive and intuitive for its users, there are
   still challenges regarding how to make it accessible to the public,
   taking into account their preferences. The purpose of this study is to
   demonstrate the benefits of implementing BIM in a real-time seat
   occupancy management system to enable reservations tailored to the
   user's needs by offering various means of consulting model information.
   The research method focuses on the utility model designed for a
   university library in Malaga, Spain. The results, based on data obtained
   from a survey, indicate that users positively assessed the quality of
   the information offered, showed great interest in its use, and also
   considered it comparatively superior to other reservation systems used.
   The Results and Discussion and Conclusions sections also show the
   potential of the system to control social distancing and energy
   expenditure.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Geographic information system (GIS) data provide geospatial data on
   cities and spatial analysis functions that are essential for urban
   design. Building information modeling (BIM) includes a digital entity of
   construction, a passive presentation of micro-digital information on
   real entities, and an active application of models in the entire life
   cycle realization of the architecture, engineering, and construction
   industries. A combination of these technologies could provide a core
   technology for the urban digital twin to support sustainable smart city
   design. Through an insightful literature review, this paper summarizes
   the different disciplinary classifications of GIS and BIM functional
   integration, distills the value of data, and discusses the
   ontology-based data integration approach that GIS and BIM should take in
   the future to conduct research on integration applications in smart
   cities. To verify this view, keyword analysis, co-country analysis, and
   co-citation and coupling analyses are conducted using CiteSpace. GIS and
   BIM integration has attracted much attention. However, a professional
   disconnect and fragmented composition pose challenges in the field of
   GIS and BIM integration. Future research should focus on smart city
   planning, updating, management; ontology-based GIS and BIM data
   integration platform; and operation; and the collaborative management of

   because it must deal with every geometric face in the BIM and every
   point in the point cloud one-to-one. To address this problem, this study
   presents a high-performance algorithm to detect discrepancies between an
   as-planned BIM and the as-is point cloud automatically. This method is a
   data structure approach based on modifiable nested octree indexing of
   surface meshes and point clouds. The results of experiments showed a
   significant computation performance improvement: 25.3 and 12.1 times
   faster than the baseline method for a complex plant facility and a
   simple indoor building, respectively. Furthermore, it was demonstrated
   that as the number of meshes in the BIM geometry increased, the time
   complexity of the proposed approach could be represented as a big
   O-notation,O(logN), where N is the number of meshes in the BIM geometry.},

Abstract = {Non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques play an important role in the
   characterization and diagnosis of historic buildings, keeping in mind
   their conservation and possible rehabilitation. This paper presents a
   new approach that merges building information modeling (BIM) with
   environment geospatial data obtained by several non-destructive
   techniques, namely terrestrial laser scanning, ground-penetrating radar,
   infrared thermography, and the automatic classification of pathologies
   based on RGB (red, green, blue) imaging acquired with an unmanned
   aircraft system (UAS). This approach was applied to the inspection of
   the Monastery of Batalha in Leiria, Portugal, a UNESCO World Heritage
   Site. To assess the capabilities of each technique, different parts of
   the monastery were examined, namely (i) part of its west facade,
   including a few protruding buttresses, and (ii) the masonry vaults of
   the Church (nave, right-hand aisle, and transept) and the Founder's
   Chapel. After describing the employed techniques, a discussion of the
   optimization, treatment and integration of the acquired data through the
   BIM approach is presented. This work intends to contribute to the
   application of BIM in the field of cultural heritage, aiming at its
   future use in different activities such as facility management, support
   in the restoration and rehabilitation process, and research.},

Abstract = {CityGML (City Geography Markup Language) is the most investigated
   standard in the integration of building information modeling (BIM) and
   the geographic information system (GIS), and it is essential for digital
   twin and smart city applications. The new CityGML 3.0 has been released
   for a while, but it is still not clear whether its new features bring
   new challenges or opportunities to this research topic. Therefore, the
   aim of this study is to understand the state of the art of CityGML in
   BIM/GIS integration and to investigate the potential influence of
   CityGML3.0 on BIM/GIS integration. To achieve this aim, this study used
   a systematic literature review approach. In total, 136 papers from Web
   of Science (WoS) and Scopus were collected, reviewed, and analyzed. The
   main findings of this review are as follows: (1) There are several
   challenging problems in the IFC-to-CityGML conversion, including LoD
   (Level of Detail) mapping, solid-to-surface conversion, and semantic
   mapping. (2) The `space' concept and the new LoD concept in CityGML 3.0
   can bring new opportunities to LoD mapping and solid-to-surface
   conversion. (3) The Versioning module and the Dynamizer module can add
   dynamic semantics to the CityGML. (4) Graph techniques and scan-to-BIM
   offer new perspectives for facilitating the use of CityGML in BIM/GIS
   integration. These findings can further facilitate theoretical studies
   on BIM/GIS integration.},

Title = {BIM Model Management for BIM-Based Facility Management in Buildings},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has recently gained popularity in
   the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Specifically,
   BIM has been applied in facilities management (FM). However,
   FM-integrated BIM and MM-integrated BIM are likely to fail when BIM-FM
   models are not effectively updated or maintained. Thus, it is critical
   to focus on the management of BIM-FM models during the operation stage
   of buildings. While several researchers have examined BIM applications
   and system developments in the context of FM, there is a dearth of
   research on BIM management, particularly in the operation stage of
   sustainable buildings. Thus, an approach for BIM-FM models management is
   herein proposed for building projects. A BIM-FM models management (BFMM)
   system for owners during the operation stage was developed to ensure
   effective implementation for the management of BIM-FM models. Using a
   building in Taiwan as a case study, this study discussed and evaluated
   the effectiveness of the proposed BFMM system. The results reveal that
   the BFMM system significantly increases the efficiency of BIM-FM model
   management. The results of this study can provide a useful reference for
   those interested in adopting BIM to manage building project facilities.
   This study concludes by presenting the advantages and limitations of
   BIM-FM models as well as suggestions for future applications.},

Abstract = {The current industrial facility market necessitates the digitization of
   both production and infrastructure to ensure compatibility. This
   digitization is presently accomplished using Building Information
   Modeling and digital twin technologies, as well as their integrated
   usage, which enhances convergence and adds further value to facility
   assets. However, these technologies primarily focus on the physical
   components of industrial facilities, neglecting processes, requirements,
   and functions. To address these gaps, the inclusion of the Model-Based
   System Engineering approach, a proven benchmark in systems engineering,
   is essential. This inclusion is the main objective of this research.
   This article outlines methods and principles for integrating Model-Based
   System Engineering into the informational modeling of existing
   industrial facilities to address current market gaps. It offers
   practical steps for such integration and compares it to other methods,
   positioning Model-Based System Engineering as a pivotal tool for
   enhancing the value of industrial facility digital assets. The main
   findings include the proposal of BIM and MBSE integration, which aims to
   create a competitive advantage for industrial facilities by improving
   customer service and operational efficiency, requiring collaboration

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Anecdotal evidence from industry and research studies acknowledges the
   shortcomings of current frameworks and tools, such as COBie add-ins made
   available by major BIM tool vendors. A primary challenge is that such
   tools heavily rely on manual data entry. Manual input is time-consuming
   and prone to human errors or omis-sions. Very few open IFC web-based BIM
   tools exist to support information exchange for facilities management
   and eliminate excess data redundancy and manual input. This paper adopts
   a software development process to create an open web-based prototype to
   bridge the gap in existing semi-automated tools such as COBie. The
   prototype created was tested using three case studies. Findings of the
   prototype test revealed challenges of the prototype's application and
   highlighted the need for replicating the IFC extracted data to the cloud
   server via linked servers in SQL. Finally, future work is proposed,
   delineating the necessity of simplifying the proposed web-based
   prototype system by integrating the desktop and cloud services into one
   integrated web-based system.},

Abstract = {Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs), as the most recognized data schema
   for Building Information Modeling (BIM), are increasingly combined with
   ontology to facilitate data interoperability across the whole lifecycle
   in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management
   (AEC/FM). This paper conducts a bibliometric analysis of 122 papers from
   the perspective of data, model, and application to summarize the modes
   of IFC and ontology integration (IFCOI). This paper first analyzes the
   data and models of the integration from IFC data formats and ontology
   development models to the IfcOWL data model. Next, the application
   status is summed up from objective and phase dimensions, and four
   frequent applications with maturity are identified. Based on the
   aforementioned multi-dimensional analysis, three integration modes are
   summarized, taking into account various data interoperability
   requirements. Accordingly, ontology behaves as the representation of
   domain knowledge, an enrichment tool for IFC model semantics, and a
   linkage between IFC data and other heterogeneous data. Finally, this
   paper points out the challenges and opportunities for IFCOI in the data,
   domain ontology, and integration process and proposes a building
   lifecycle management model based on IFCOI.},

Title = {A Hybrid BIM-Fuzzy Model for Enhanced Assessment of Building Element
   Conditions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This study addresses the critical challenge of managing building element
   defects, such as cracks and dampness, which contribute to increased
   repair and maintenance costs. Highlighting the need to minimize human
   error and enhance the accuracy of defect classification, the research
   proposes a novel method integrating building information modeling (BIM)
   with a fuzzy algorithm, derived from extensive fieldwork and data
   collection. This innovative approach aims to systematize and automate
   the process of defect management, thus reducing the potential for human
   error. A BIM model tailored to asset management is developed following
   specific fuzzy building information modeling (FBIM) guidelines. For
   proper decision-making, by using a fuzzy algorithm an effective
   defect-based building elements condition assessment fuzzy model was
   produced according to field data that can show the severity of the
   degradation of building elements. This algorithm categorizes the
   condition of building elements from good to bad (C1 to C5) and damage
   severity from no damage to collapse (D1 to D5), providing a nuanced
   understanding of building elements' health that traditional methods
   might overlook due to human error. Implemented on the BIM platform, this
   model enhances information exchange and documentation during
   inspections, utilizing visualization to evaluate building elements
   through color-coded causality analysis. A case study of an office
   building illustrates how the fuzzy model, underpinned by field-derived
   data, significantly improves asset management practices by minimizing
   human errors in defect identification and classification. The paper
   concludes by highlighting the contribution of this research to the
   construction industry, offering a sophisticated framework for defect
   management that combines detailed BIM visualization with the precision
   of a fuzzy algorithm informed by extensive fieldwork, ultimately leading
   to improved building quality and operational cost savings.},

Title = {The Relevance of Automation in the Facility Management of Selected
   High-Rise Buildings in Lagos, Nigeria},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Operators (owners/facility managers) of high-rise buildings are
   continuously faced with the challenge of finding innovative means of
   controlling and managing the facilities of high-rise buildings. This is
   due to consistent change in the nature and functions of building
   systems. Meanwhile, the use of computerized systems affords building
   operators the tools and methods that will enhance facility management
   activities. This study examined the importance of automation to the
   facility management of high-rise buildings in developing countries,
   using the case of Nigeria. The study adopted a survey research approach,
   administering a structured questionnaire to 53 facility managers of
   identified commercial high-rise buildings in Ikoyi, Lagos Island, and
   Victoria Island in Nigeria. It also applied regression analysis in
   determining the significance of automation on facility management
   activities. The findings of the study revealed that security services
   are the most automated facility management activity. Results also showed
   that automation had a positive effect on facility management practice,
   with R square of 0.66. The study concluded that although automation is
   seldom used in carrying out facility management activities, it has a
   positive impact on facility management services, with 66\% significance
   level on facility management activities. It then recommended that steps
   should be taken by all stakeholders to develop the practice of facility
   management and research, as well as facility management education.},

Title = {Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis on the Integration of Geographic
   Information Systems and Building Information Modeling for the Generation
   and Management of 3D Models},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},

Abstract = {3D virtual management is a topic of growing interest. The AEC industry
   is undergoing a real revolution because of the technological changes
   that are taking place. Synchronized 3D visualization is one of the tools
   being deployed at an accelerated pace. This, together with collaborative
   work, contributes to optimal management for all stakeholders. The
   integration of geographic information systems and building information
   modeling and heritage BIM is one of the most innovative concepts; it
   enables the generation of collaborative, fluid systems. The objective of
   this research is to identify the most significant technological
   developments and potential applications of the aforementioned
   integration. For this purpose, after a bibliographic consultation
   (26,245 sources), two analyses are carried out (from the screening of
   179 sources), one quantitative (bibliometric) and the other qualitative
   (focused on five key concepts). The results show that regarding the
   integration of GIS with BIM and HBIM, the highest concentration of
   contributions is in engineering with 30.66\%, followed by computer
   science with 21.01\%. The country with the highest number of citations
   is China with 717, followed by Australia and the USA with 549 and 513,
   respectively, but relativizing the number of citations based on various
   indices (human development index, gross national income per capita, and
   population-tertiary education level), Hong Kong (18.04), Australia
   (10.64), and Egypt (10.16) would take the top positions, respectively.
   Regarding universities, the entity that has generated the most
   references is Delft University of Technology (the Netherlands) with 15
   papers, followed by University College London (UK) with 13. Finally, the
   results show that GIS and BIM and HBIM provide virtual 3D models with
   multiple applications for buildings and infrastructures.},

Title = {A critical study of the existing issues in manufacturing maintenance
   systems: Can BIM fill the gap?},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {131},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The use of smart and complicated technologies in manufacturing
   industries has brought new issues to the maintenance systems in recent
   years. In this research, an intensive literature review is performed to
   identify and classify these issues. Inspired by the recent advances that
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) has brought to the construction
   industry, the research proposes adopting BIM in manufacturing
   maintenance systems to address the existing issues. A list of BIM
   capabilities utilized for addressing maintenance issues of buildings is
   extracted from the literature. It is argued that these BIM capabilities
   can also solve similar maintenance issues found in manufacturing
   industries. A BIM-based corrective maintenance model for an aluminum
   casting plant is developed to investigate the application of sample BIM
   capabilities in a manufacturing maintenance system. Twenty maintenance
   experts are invited to interact with the developed pilot model. Rapid
   locating of equipment requiring repairs, easy access to documents and
   records, efficient collaborative cloud environment, and expedited
   operations are among the identified advantages of BIM capabilities in
   the case. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by
   providing a comprehensive list of categorized manufacturing maintenance
   issues. Nominated BIM capabilities to address the identified
   manufacturing maintenance issues are recommended. The achieved results
   of this research can inspire manufacturing maintenance practitioners and
   researchers to adopt similar technologies to BIM to improve
   manufacturing maintenance systems. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {In situ modeling methodologies in building operation: A review},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {230},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {The building information and operational data generated during the
   building life cycle are essential for realizing energy-efficient
   operation, indoor environmental quality, and digitalization in the
   context of intelligent buildings. At the city scale, building operation
   information is necessary to evaluate and improve energy efficiency to
   achieve carbon neutrality in the building sector. When considering
   long-term operation over the building life cycle with the basic modeling
   environments available during the design stage, conventional modeling
   approaches for building informatization and digitalization provide
   limited reliability and availability owing to different building
   designs, gaps between design and operation, aging-related changes, and
   experimental issues. These challenges require an in situ modeling
   perspective throughout the building life cycle. Therefore, based on the
   literature reviews, this paper proposes and discusses in situ modeling
   methodologies for building operations according to six aspects: modeling
   environment, model purpose, model source, modeling approach, in situ
   verification, and in situ calibration. They are mainly discussed by two
   modeling environments including (1) in situ modeling with the model
   observations and (2) onsite modeling without the observations. Practical
   challenges for in situ modeling are discussed. Various in situ modeling
   scenarios and strategies are then suggested, and in situ model fusion is
   proposed to overcome the limitations of extant building operation
   modeling environments. Future research directions are proposed to
   facilitate continuous information modeling and digitalization of
   operations throughout the building life cycle.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF OBJECT TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Models are an inherent part of the construction industry, which
   leverages from the steady advancements in information and communication
   technology. One of these advancements is Building Information Modeling
   (BIM), which denotes the move from 2D drawings to having semantically
   rich models of the objects subject to construction. Additionally, the
   way stakeholders collaborate in construction projects and their
   organization is revisited. This is commonly denoted as Integrated
   Project Delivery (IPD). Both BIM and IPD originate from the basic
   principles of Lean Construction, the vision to minimize waste, increase
   value, and continuous improvement. The application of Model-driven
   Software Engineering (MDSE) to BIM is a natural choice. Although several
   approaches utilizing MDSE for BIM have been proposed, so far no
   structured overview of the current state of the art has been conducted.
   Such an overview is vitally needed, because the existing literature is
   fragmented among multiple research areas. Consequently, in this paper,
   we present a systematic literature review on the application of MDSE to
   BIM, IPD and Lean Construction resulting in a systematically derived
   taxonomy, which we used to classify 97 papers published between 2008 and
   2018. Based on the taxonomy, we provide an analysis of the classified
   research showing (a) where the discourse on model-driven construction
   engineering currently is, (b) the state of the art of model-driven
   techniques in construction engineering and (c) open research challenges.},

Abstract = {The importance of building information is highly attached to the ability
   of conventional storing to provide professional analysis. The Internet
   of Things (IoT) and smart devices offer a vast amount of live data
   stored in heterogeneous repositories, and hence the need for smart
   methodologies to facilitate IoT-BIM integration is very crucial. The
   first step to better integrating IoT and Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) can be performed by implementing the Service-Oriented-Architecture
   (SOA) to combining software and other services by replacing the sematic
   information that was failed to display elements of indoor conditions.
   The other development is to create link that able to update static
   models towards real-time models using SOA approach. The existing
   approach relies on one-way interaction; however, developing two-way
   communication to mimic human cognitive has become very crucial. The
   high-tech approach requires highly involving Cloud computations to
   better connect IoT devices throughout Internet infrastructure. This
   approach is based on the integration of Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) with real-time data from IoT devices aiming at improving
   construction and operational efficiencies and to provide high-fidelity
   BIM models for numerous applications. The paper discusses challenges,
   limitations, and barriers that face BIM-IoT integration and
   simultaneously solves interoperability issues and Cloud computing. The
   paper provides a comprehensive review that explores and identifies
   common emerging areas of application and common design patterns of the
   traditional BIM-IoT integration followed by devising better
   methodologies to integrate IoT in BIM.},

Title = {Developing a Building Fire Information Management System Based on 3D
   Object Visualization},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In a building fire disaster, a variety of information on hazardous
   factors is crucial for emergency responders, facility managers, and
   rescue teams. Inadequate information management limits the accuracy and
   speed of fire rescue activities. Furthermore, a poor decision-making
   process, which is solely dependent on the experiences of emergency
   responders, negatively affects the fire response activities. Building
   information modeling (BIM) enables the sharing of locations of critical
   elements and key information necessary for effective decision-making on
   disaster prevention. However, it is non-trivial to integrate and link
   the relevant information generated during the life cycle of the
   building. In particular, the information requirements for building fires
   should be retrieved in the BIM software because most of them have
   spatial characteristics. This paper proposes a prototype system for a
   building's fire information management using three-dimensional (3D)
   visualization by deriving the relevant information required for
   mitigating building fire disasters. The proposed system (i.e., Building
   Fire Information Management System (BFIMS)) automatically provides
   reliable fire-related information through a computerized and systematic
   approach in conjunction with a BIM tool. It enables emergency responders
   to intuitively identify the location data of indoor facilities with its
   pertinent information based on 3D objects. Through scenario-based
   applications, the system has effectively demonstrated that it has
   contributed to an improvement of rapid access to relevant},

Title = {Building information modeling (BIM) in project management: a
   bibliometric and science mapping review},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {32},
Number = {5},
Pages = {3078-3103},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Purpose - The impact of building information modeling (BIM) on various
   aspects of project management has attracted much attention in the past
   decade. However, previous studies have focused on a particular facet of
   project management (e.g., safety, quality, facility management) and
   within identified target journals. Despite numerous existing studies,
   there is limited research on the mainstream research topics, gaps and
   future research directions on BIM in project management. This study aims
   to conduct a bibliometric and science mapping review of published
   articles on BIM in project management and to identify mainstream
   research topics, research gaps and future research directions in this
   domain. Design/methodology/approach - A science mapping approach
   consisting of bibliometric search, scientometric analysis and
   qualitative discussion was used to analyze 521 journal articles that
   were retrieved from the Scopus database and related to BIM in project
   management. In the scientometric analysis, keyword co-occurrence
   analysis and document analysis were performed. This was followed by a
   qualitative discussion that seeks to propose a framework summarizing the
   interconnection between the mainstream research topics, research gaps
   and future research directions. Findings - Six mainstream research
   topics were found including (1) BIM-enabled advanced digital
   technologies, (2) BIM-based reinforcement and enhancement, (3) BIM and
   project composition, (4) BIM project elements and attributes, (5)
   BIM-based collaboration and communication and (6) BIM-based information
   and data. Moreover, this study discussed six research gaps, namely, (1)
   integration of BIM and other digital technologies, (2) future maturity
   of BIM applications in project management, (3) application of BIM in
   project components and processes, (4) role of BIM application in project
   elements and attributes, (5) impact of collaboration and communication
   in BIM application and (6) stability of information and data
   interaction. Furthermore, future research directions were discussed.
   Originality/value - The findings and proposed framework contribute to
   providing a deeper understanding to researchers, policymakers and
   practitioners in the development of related research and practice in the
   domain of BIM in project management, thus, promoting digital
   transformation in project management. Overall, it adds to the global
   knowledge domain in BIM and promotes the need for digital and data
   integration, BIM maturity and BIM collaboration.},

Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has emerged as a prospective
   technology used to advance the practices of construction projects. Also,
   Internet of Things (IoT), as a technology that connects sensing devices
   to share information across platforms, has become essential in building
   and construction environment. The integration of BIM-IoT in the
   construction industry, a high-risk industry, might increase overall
   performance and reduce related hazards. However, there is a dearth of
   studies on the integration of BIM and IoT in the construction industry.
   Scoping review of literature was performed using various databases such
   as IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, ACM, Emerald Insight, and Taylors \&
   Francis databases to explore the study demographics, research direction,
   category, adoption, and performance of the BIM-IoT integration for the
   construction industry. Out of 2270 articles identified, a total of 81
   key and vital articles were found and collected in scoping review to
   formulate the research questions. The study results revealed that the
   literature related to BIM-IoT integration and adoption is moderately
   steady, with constant output in the last four years. Twelve of the
   contributions were identified, and five were identified to be proposed
   more and conducted by researchers: investigation, evaluation, model,
   framework, and system. Also, fifteen (18.51\%) studies were identified
   from the selected works that were evaluated using performance
   measurement. The findings shed light on some of the most significant
   difficulties in research related to BIM-IoT integration in the
   construction industries as well as potential future initiatives.},

Abstract = {Technological advancements focusing on effective and efficient
   information modeling, visualization, resource tracking, and
   collaboration have gained substantial traction in the architectural,
   engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) industry in
   the last 10 years. The use of advanced technologies has resulted in
   safer jobsites hosting more productive project teams building more
   sustainable and resilient facilities and infrastructure. Recently, the
   innovative use of data and analytical approaches has had a major
   positive effect on a variety of businesses by incorporating data-driven
   applications and approaches. However, the AEC/FM industry is still
   lagging behind many other industries in leveraging the true power of
   data. Data analytics concepts and tools integrated with emerging
   construction trends such as building information modeling (BIM) have a
   high potential to revolutionize industry practices. This paper
   consolidates the record of current efforts in the AEC/FM body of
   knowledge (BOK) and body of practice (BOP) that incorporate the use of
   Data Analytics with common Technology Trends in various Application
   Areas. Identifying common subsections of each category, a three
   dimensional evidenced taxonomy was developed that maps (1) Data
   Analytics concepts such as cloud computing and machine learning onto,
   (2) AEC/FM emerging trends such as BIM and automation, and (3) existing
   and potential AEC/FM applications such as safety and progress
   monitoring. To further expand the validity of the results and explore
   opportunities and potential, a survey with the same categorization was
   developed and distributed among industry experts. Comparing the results
   of the exploration of the BOK and the survey illustrated the popularity
   of BIM among industry practitioners and in academic research. Also,
   process efficiency and productivity improvement were the two Application
   Areas that demonstrated the most potential to benefit from the
   integration of Data Analytics and Technology Trends. Analysis of the
   survey results indicated that, with a 95\% confidence level, there is no
   statistically significant difference among the Technology Trends or
   Application Areas, as identified in the literature, that can benefit
   from Data Analytics. The results presented in this study demonstrate
   evidence of the revolutionizing power of Data Analytics in the AEC/FM
   industry.},

   reduction in the building sector has been recognised at the highest
   level of governments around the world. One potential solution, which has
   yet to be critically considered, is the application of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) to overcome building energy performance gap
   (BEPG), defined as the discrepancy between the designed and actual
   energy consumption in buildings. This study performs a systematic and
   comprehensive literature review to identify the specific causes of the
   BEPG, and then analyses the application of BIM for addressing the BEPG.
   A life-cycle BIM engaged framework was developed, including the function
   of ``information exchange{''}, ``design review{''}, ``energy-related
   quality control{''}, ``life-cycle commissioning{''}, and ``real-time
   operation and maintenance management{''}. It is expected that the
   proposed framework will assist researchers and practitioners better
   understand application of BIM to systematically improve building energy
   performance. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Rebaselining Asset Data for Existing Facilities and Infrastructure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This paper introduces ``rebaselining{''} as a workflow for collecting
   reliable and verifiable asset management data for existing facilities
   and infrastructure. Reporting on two action research case studies with
   two public owners in the US, this research structures rebaselining in
   four phases: (1) preparing technology enablers, (2) collecting data from
   existing documents, (3) conducting field verification, and (4) updating
   asset management databases. These workflows address some of the common
   challenges in managing existing assets, including the fast-paced changes
   in asset data requirements, the inaccuracies in data and documentation
   of these existing assets portfolios, and the need to update data and
   documents over their life cycle. The findings set the groundwork for
   implementing workflow by mapping the rebaselining business processes in
   each phase, listing the technological requirements for these processes,
   and explaining the feasibility and examples of customizing building
   information modeling (BIM) platforms for rebaselining workflows. This
   customization of BIM platforms aims to offer simplified solutions that
   reduce the facility management staff's need for advanced BIM software
   knowledge.},

Title = {EXPLORING THE ENTERPRISE BIM CONCEPT IN PRACTICE: THE CASE OF ASSET
   MANAGEMENT IN A NORWEGIAN HOSPITAL},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {Organizations face challenges in utilizing Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) for digital Asset Management (AM), as BIM from the design and
   construction phases often proves to be of limited use for AM. To address
   this, the concept of Enterprise BIM is introduced with the aim of
   organizing BIM activities throughout the lifecycle in line with the
   organization's operational and strategic needs. The article explores the
   current industry practices of implementing Enterprise BIM for effective
   AM support. It focuses on Vestfold Health Trust and its award-winning
   hospital project in Toensberg, Norway, which was notable for its use of
   Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) and its attempts to adopt Enterprise
   BIM methodologies and solutions. Through literature studies and
   interviews with fifteen key personnel, the article provides
   recommendations for significant improvement within ontological
   adaptation, and associated IT solutions needs. The results highlight the
   limitations of using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema and
   format for AM applications and suggest the development of flexible,
   searchable solutions based on ontologies and semantics to integrate
   sensor data into digital twins and asset information models. The study
   reveals a competency gap and deficiencies in information processes and
   IT solutions that organizations, along with the industry, must both
   address, emphasizing the use of international standards such as ISO
   19650 to improve the integration of value chain considerations. Overall,
   this article provides valuable recommendations and a roadmap for the
   more strategic, holistic, and sustainable management of building
   information that aims to take into account and satisfy the end-user's
   information needs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Pages = {97-114},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Diverse industries have recognized the significance of a neutral data
   standard for seamless building information modeling (BIM) data exchanges
   and adopted commonly agreed schemes such as the industry foundation
   classes (IFC) schema for enhancing BIM data interoperability. To
   selectively employ domain-specific data exchange requirements, the
   AEC-FM (the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility
   Management) industries have developed their own schema with a subset of
   the IFC schema, named a model view definition (MVD). However, because of
   latent human errors, inadequate MVD definitions, and error-prone data
   mapping problems, the adoption of IFC for exchanging and sharing BIM
   data is frequently limited with severe data integrity issues. This
   challenging situation requires the detailed examination of the
   limitations of the heterogeneous IFC translation processes of the
   current BIM authoring and application tools. To accomplish this
   objective, the authors thoroughly investigated the two MVDs, the
   Coordination View Version 2.0 and the Construction Operations Building
   Information Exchange, broadly used as an international standard for
   developing the IFC translation processes, and then identified their
   intrinsic requirements/rules and developed rule-based data validation
   processes. These new intrinsic knowledge of the two MVD specifications
   will be fundamental foundations to create coherent BIM data exchange
   systems that are currently scattered and dispersed in heterogeneous IFC
   translation processes and structures. Newly revealed rules pertaining to
   these two MVDs have been executed with IfcDoc, which is the IFC
   documentation tool. This BIM data validation process is expected to not
   only accurately evaluate the translation processes between BIM native
   data and IFC ones but also help industry professionals ensure the
   integrity and the accuracy of their BIM data according to the BIM data
   exchange standards using the two MVDs. In addition, the outcomes of this
   research study are expected to bolster the interoperable BIM adoption
   and offer the values of greater consistency of BIM data exchange.},

Abstract = {Representation and modeling using the building information modeling
   (BIM) methodology of civil works have become the subject of increasing
   attention in recent years, thanks to the potential offered by Open
   Infrastructure BIM (I-BIM). However, the complexity of infrastructure
   works, i.e., the variety of construction and technological systems,
   makes Open I-BIM very complex and challenging. The lack of systemic
   knowledge on the subject is another challenging factor. The aim of the
   following research work is to provide a synoptic overview of the
   existing scientific research, accompanied by the most recent studies in
   the field of computer modeling, its applications, and the main
   opportunities that Open I-BIM offers to the infrastructure sector. After
   a thorough review of 198 scientific articles published between 2013 and
   2023, this study systematically presents a holistic review and critical
   reflection on the current status of the use of Open BIM in the
   infrastructure sector, with a focus on the development of the tools and
   methods used. The outcome of this work constitutes a systematic review
   of the literature with a bibliometric analysis on Open I-BIM, which is
   able to provide a knowledge base for identifying research trends, common
   problems, and the potential of developed methods.},

Title = {Digital Twin framework for automated fault source detection and
   prediction for comfort performance evaluation of existing
   non-residential Norwegian buildings},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {281},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Numerous buildings fall short of expectations regarding occupant
   satisfaction, sustainability, or energy efficiency. In this paper, the
   performance of buildings in terms of occupant comfort is evaluated using
   a probabilistic model based on Bayesian networks (BNs). The BN model is
   founded on an in-depth anal-ysis of satisfaction survey responses and a
   thorough study of building performance parameters. This study also
   presents a user-friendly visualization compatible with BIM to simplify
   data collecting in two case studies from Norway with data from 2019 to
   2022. This paper proposes a novel Digital Twin approach for
   incorporating building information modeling (BIM) with real-time sensor
   data, occupants' feedback, a probabilistic model of occupants' comfort,
   and HVAC faults detection and prediction that may affect occupants'
   comfort. New methods for using BIM as a visualization platform, as well
   as a pre-dictive maintenance method to detect and anticipate problems in
   the HVAC system, are also presented. These methods will help
   decision-makers improve the occupants' comfort conditions in buildings.
   However, due to the intricate interaction between numerous equipment and
   the absence of data integra-tion among FM systems, CMMS, BMS, and BIM
   data are integrated in this paper into a framework utilizing ontology
   graphs to generalize the Digital Twin framework so it can be applied to
   many buildings. The results of this study can aid decision-makers in the
   facility management sector by offering insight into the aspects that
   influence occupant comfort, speeding up the process of identifying
   equipment malfunc-tions, and pointing toward possible solutions.(c) 2022

Abstract = {This study introduces an innovative data-BIM integrated digital twin
   framework for the quality monitoring residential developments. The
   framework amalgamates residential building information modeling (RBIM),
   surveying sensors and Internet of Things (SSIoT) technologies to
   establish a multi-faceted and multi-scale monitoring system. Within this
   framework, RBIM serves as a residential information twin model that
   aggregates comprehensive life cycle data of residential projects,
   encompassing design, building, operation, and maintenance. The physical
   things are linked to cyberspace via SSIoT technology, significantly
   improving data exchange and processing capabilities. To address the
   limitations of singular monitoring technology, a BIM collaborative
   multi-source data monitoring method for residential engineering quality
   is proposed, utilizing the BIM model alongside the advancement of
   real-time transmitting monitoring LiDAR, automated monitoring robots,
   GNSS, and various other sensors. This framework seeks to create a novel
   paradigm for intelligent, comprehensive data management and synthesizing
   heterogeneous data from several sources, focusing on the quality
   monitoring of residential projects to guarantee quality, safety, and

   disasters.Design/methodology/approachFacility managers can monitor the
   status of gas transmission lines in real-time by integrating sensor
   information into a building information modeling (BIM) 3D model. Using
   the Monitoring Panel plugin, coded in C\# programming language and
   operated through Navisworks software, the model provides up-to-date
   information on pipeline safety and performance.FindingsBy collecting
   project information on the BIM and installing critical sensors, this
   approach allows facility manager to observe the real-time safety status
   of gas pipelines. If any risks of gas leakage or accidents are
   identified by the sensors, the BIM model quickly shows the location of
   the incident, enabling facility managers to make the best decisions to
   reduce financial and life risks. This intelligent gas transmission
   pipeline approach changes traditional risk management and inspection
   methods, minimizing the risk of explosion and gas leakage in the
   environment.Originality/valueThis research distinguishes itself from
   related work by integrating sensor data into a BIM model for real-time
   monitoring and providing facility managers with up-to-date safety
   information. By leveraging intelligent gas transmission pipelines, the
   system enables quick identification and location of potential hazards,
   reducing financial and human risks associated with gas transmission.},

Title = {FROM BIM TO DIGITAL TWINS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EVOLUTION OF
   INTELLIGENT BUILDING REPRESENTATIONS IN THE AEC-FM INDUSTRY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {58-83},
Abstract = {The widespread adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and the
   recent emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) applications offer several
   new insights and decision-making capabilities throughout the life cycle
   of the built environment. In recent years, the ability of real-time
   connectivity to online sensors deployed in an environment has led to the
   emergence of the concept of the Digital Twin of the built environment.
   Digital Twins aim to achieve synchronization of the real world with a
   virtual platform for seamless management and control of the construction
   process, facility management, environment monitoring, and other life
   cycle processes in the built environment. However, research in Digital
   Twins for the built environment is still in its nascent stages and there
   is a need to understand the advances in the underlying enabling
   technologies and establish a convergent context for ongoing and future
   research. This paper conducted a systematic review to identify the
   development of the emerging technologies facilitating the evolution of
   BIM to Digital Twins in built environment applications. A total of 100
   related papers including 23 review papers were selected and reviewed. In
   order to systematically classify the reviewed studies, the authors
   developed a five-level ladder categorization system based on the
   building life cycle to reflect the current state-of-the-art in Digital
   Twin applications. In each level of this taxonomy, applications were
   further categorized based on their research domains (e.g., construction
   process, building energy performance, indoor environment monitoring). In
   addition, the current state-of-art in technologies enabling Digital
   Twins was also summarized from the reviewed literature. It was found
   that most of the prior studies conducted thus far have not fully
   exploited or realized the envisioned concept of the Digital Twin, and
   thus classify under the earlier ladder categories. Based on the analysis
   of the reviewed work and the trends in ongoing research, the authors
   propose a concept of an advanced Digital Twin for building management as
   a baseline for further studies.},

Title = {Automated Reconstruction of Parametric BIM for Bridge Based on
   Terrestrial Laser Scanning Data},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) in industrialized bridge
   construction is usually performed based on initial design information.
   Differences exist between the model of the structure and its actual
   geometric dimensions and features due to the manufacturing,
   transportation, hoisting, assembly, and load bearing of the structure.
   These variations affect the construction project handover and facility
   management. The solutions available at present entail the use of point
   clouds to reconstruct BIM. However, these solutions still encounter
   problems, such as the inability to obtain the actual geometric features
   of a bridge quickly and accurately. Moreover, the created BIM is
   nonparametric and cannot be dynamically adjusted. This paper proposes a
   fully automatic method of reconstructing parameterized BIM by using
   point clouds to address the abovementioned problems. An algorithm for
   bridge point cloud segmentation is developed; the algorithm can separate
   the bridge point cloud from the entire scanning scene and segment the
   unit structure point cloud. Another algorithm for extracting the
   geometric features of the bridge point cloud is also proposed; this
   algorithm is effective for partially missing point clouds. The
   feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated and verified using
   theoretical and actual bridge point clouds, respectively. The
   reconstruction quality of BIM is also evaluated visually and
   quantitatively, and the results show that the reconstructed BIM is
   accurate and reliable.},

Title = {BIM model for the operational phase based on available documentation},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {71},
Number = {1},
Pages = {347-363},
Abstract = {For several years, there has been an intensification of using BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) technology in the design and
   construction phases of building projects. However, it is rare to come
   across data regarding the implementation and subsequent verification of
   the utilization of BIM's capabilities in the longest phase of a
   building's life cycle - the operational phase. Currently, various
   property management systems and methods are applied during the
   operational phase of volumetric construction. However, these are often
   systems dedicated to specific types of activities (e.g., invoicing,
   electronic documentation approval), often requiring a significant amount
   of manual work. Additionally, current practices do not integrate the
   systems in use, and manual processing results in the manager receiving
   scattered and unformatted data that is difficult to use in daily
   operations. The aim of this article is to present the potential benefits
   of implementing BIM technology during the operational phase of a
   facility. The article outlines the possibilities of using the
   information introduced into the BIM model during the operational phase
   of a building. It also presents a proposed approach for creating a BIM
   model for the operational phase. In a subsequent article, the authors
   will focus on presenting an example of its implementation.},

Title = {Fully automated generation of parametric BIM for MEP scenes based on
   terrestrial laser scanning data},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {125},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {As-built building information modeling (BIM) has gained much attention
   in mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) systems for better facility
   management. To create as-built BIMs, laser scanning technology is widely
   used to collect raw data due to its high measurement speed and accuracy.
   Currently, as-built models are mostly drawn by experienced personnel in
   BIM modeling software with point cloud data as reference, which is labor
   intensive and time consuming. This study presents a fully automated
   approach to converting terrestrial laser scanning data to well-connected
   as-built BIMs for MEP scenes. According to the geometry complexity, MEP
   components are divided into regular shaped components and irregular
   shaped components. A 2D to 3D analysis framework is developed to detect
   objects and extract accurate geometry information for the two categories
   of MEP components. Firstly, the MEP scene is divided into slices on
   which rough geometry information of components? cross sections is
   extracted. Then, the extracted information on different slices is
   integrated and analyzed in 3D space to verify the existence of MEP
   components and obtain refined geometry information used for modeling.
   Following the detection stage, an MEP network construction approach is
   developed for MEP components connection and position fine-tuning.
   Finally, the extracted geometry information and connection relationships
   are imported into Dynamo to automatically generate the parametric BIM
   model. To validate the feasibility of the proposed technique,
   experiments were conducted with point clouds acquired from three scenes
   in Hong Kong. A comprehensive assessment is presented to evaluate the
   as-built model quality with three indices: retrieval rate, geometry
   parameter accuracy and deviation from point clouds to as-built model.
   The experiment results show that the proposed technique could
   successfully transform laser scanning data of MEP scenes to as-built
   BIMs with sufficient accuracy for facility management purpose.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has revolutionized the construction
   industry as a platform for core integrated design, modeling, asset
   planning, and collaboration. Although BIM simplifies the retrieval and
   use of information in construction projects, BIM tools use native
   formats that pose challenges for data reuse and exchange. This article
   proposes a method for mapping BIM data into sets of concepts of a
   specific domains, and the use of Semantic Web tools for the exchange of
   data and information. Domain ontologies are a widely used tool for the
   formal definition of a field of knowledge, which facilitates the
   exchange of information in heterogeneous systems through technologies
   such as the Semantic Web. The proposed mapping can be used to enrich
   information and improve data integration in systems based on semantic
   tools that manage services or maintain facilities and building
   infrastructures. The article also presents a case study based on the
   management of airport facilities to illustrate the practical application

Abstract = {The research was carried out to determine the shortest route between two
   points in a maze-shaped room using the BIM model and a script created in
   Dynamo. The matrix method of route calculation was used to find the
   optimal relation between the accuracy of the calculated route and the
   time needed for calculations. In order to indicate the factors
   influencing the extension of the calculation time and mutual relation of
   factors, tests were carried out for different variants of the floorplan
   modification (room area, the surface of internal walls, distance between
   the entrance and exit in a straight line and within the boundary marked
   by walls of the maze). The results of all trials were presented
   graphically. Based on the obtained results, a definition of Benefit
   Factor was introduced, aimed at assessing and comparing objectively a
   performance in individual attempts to solve the task. On this basis, the
   method of assessment and selection of the preferred mesh density for
   further applications has been proposed.},

Title = {Possibilities of BIM-FM for the Management of COVID in Public Buildings},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 49.7 million reported cases and
   over 1.2 million deaths globally confirmed deaths at the time of
   writing, demands global action to counteract this virus. It is widely
   accepted that COVID-19 is a long-term pandemic that will require a
   constant and innovative range of mitigation approaches to protect public
   health. This paper provides infrastructure facility management (FM)
   systems based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) to reduce the
   likelihood of COVID-19 infections indoors. Although there are several
   factors for dealing with COVID-19, the sole focus of this project is to
   reduce crowding and facilitate social distancing between occupants. The
   significance of this research relies on the use of mathematical methods,
   BIM, programming as well as FM tools and databases to achieve safer
   management of large and populated public buildings during the COVID-19
   pandemic. The infrastructure management example refers to the Civil
   Engineering School at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid. It is based
   on mathematical applications to find the paths of people paths inside
   the infrastructure and is synchronized with in-house developed software

Title = {Towards product-level parallel computing of large-scale building
   information modeling data using graph theory},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {169},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Building Information Model/Modeling (BIM) upgrades the digitization of
   buildings from 2D to 3D and has become a common paradigm in
   architecture, engineering, construction, operation, and facility
   management (AECO/FM) industry. Many studies have argued that the volume
   of BIM keeps increasing and becomes extremely large as projects proceed.
   However, processing large-scale BIM data in parallel is still an open
   issue due to the complicated reference relationships in a BIM. This
   study addresses this issue by introducing graph theory. Firstly, a novel
   directed reference graph (DrGraph) model is proposed to capture the
   reference relationships among BIM instances according to the Industrial
   Foundation Classes (IFC) specification. On top of DrGraph, BIM product
   slice (ProSlice) model is developed to split the original IFC file into
   small independent IFC slices in product level. Since the generated
   slices are independent of each other, they can be dispatched and
   computed in a parallel computing cluster. The usage of ProSlice in
   MapReduce is illustrated using the BIM triangulation task. Finally,
   experimental results show that our proposed product-level parallel
   computing scheme has a better performance in both computation efficiency
   and internal memory usage than floor-level ones, and that parallel
   computing scales the computation of BIM data. Our product-level parallel
   computing scheme can also envision other geometric data processing and
   semantic data analysis of large-scale BIM data.},

Abstract = {This paper articulates the fund allocation and prioritization challenge
   for existing building facilities' Maintenance and Repair (M \& R)
   interventions. Despite the existing conspicuous research in funding
   allocation, there is a dearth of comprehensive insight into which
   facilities necessitate maintenance, when to intervene, and the
   strategies to adopt. Integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) and
   Facility Management data for fund allocation decisions remains
   challenging, and existing models lack a thorough portrayal of as-is
   information for M \& R interventions and funding allocation. To this
   end, this study proposes an integrated BIM-based fund allocation and
   prioritization framework to bridge these gaps. The framework
   incorporates as-is BIM semantic knowledge and utilizes a genetic
   algorithm optimization scheme to determine interventions based on
   condition state, future deterioration rate, and relative weighted
   importance. The research objectives include constructing an as-is BIM
   model, formalizing as-is knowledge using BIM standards, allocating
   funding efficiently, and determining optimum timing and type of
   interventions. The developed framework is enacted in a real-case
   scenario for validation and verification, and findings unveiled the
   proposed paradigm capabilities as a decision support system for fund
   allocation and prioritization, enabling facility managers to constitute
   informed decisions based on building facilities' as-is information,
   deterioration rates, and relative importance weight.},

Title = {Route Planning for Fire Rescue Operations in Long-Term Care Facilities
   Using Ontology and Building Information Models},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As our society ages, more and more elderly or disabled people live in
   long-term care (LTC) facilities, which are vulnerable to fires and may
   result in heavy casualties. Because of the low mobility of LTC
   residents, firefighters often need to enter the facility to save people.
   In addition, due to LTC facility management needs, many doors or windows
   on the passages for a fire rescue operation may be blocked. Thus,
   firefighters have to employ forcible entry tools such as disk cutters
   for passing through, which may lengthen the rescue time if an incorrect
   route or tool is utilized. As new information technologies such as
   ontology and building information modeling (BIM) have matured, this
   research aims at proposing a BIM-based ontology model to help
   firefighters determine better rescue routes instead of using rules of
   thumb. Factors such as the path length, building components and
   materials encountered, and forcible entry tools carried are considered
   in the model. Real LTC fire investigation reports are used for the
   comparisons between the original routes and the ones generated by the
   proposed model, and seven experts joined the evaluation workshop to
   provide further insights. The experts agreed that using the proposed
   approach can lead to better fire rescue route planning. The proposed
   BIM-based ontology model could be extended to accommodate additional
   needs for hospital fire scenes, in the hopes of enhancing the efficiency
   and effectiveness of firefighters' rescue operations in such important
   facilities.},

Abstract = {The construction industry lacks a comprehensive and overall scheme for
   the use and management of building information modeling (BIM) in the
   whole building life cycle, especially the use of BIM technology for
   asset management and facility management. However, there is little
   understanding and implementation of enterprise BIM. BIM influences and
   changes the new project management mode of the whole life cycle of
   construction projects from design to construction. The safety, audit,
   responsibility and value of BIM are the forward-looking problems in
   current BIM, but it is difficult to realize the whole process value
   management based on the contribution of all parties, it is not conducive
   to the popularization and application of BIM. From the perspective of
   new technology and the whole life cycle, this paper analyzes the
   development and promotion of Blockchain technology to construction
   projects, and puts forward the fusion point of BIM and Blockchain
   technology: multi-user, multi-stage, multi-target data fusion and
   traceability mechanism; It is a consensus process model of multi-party
   collaboration, interest balance, non-destructive transmission of
   building information, responsibility traceability and customer
   satisfaction. It realizes the supporting framework and implementation
   ideas of BIM and Blockchain technology in construction projects from the
   aspects of design technology, construction management, material

Abstract = {Purpose Successful implementation of a building information modeling
   (BIM) for building operation and maintenance (O\&M) requires purposeful,
   early-design identification of end-user-specific model exchange
   requirements. This paper aims to provide a semantic data-rich
   classification system for model objects to convey facilities management
   (FM) requirements in BIM guidelines in support of efficient FM-BIM data
   workflows. Design/methodology/approach A modularized, repeatable and
   technical solution for semantic requirements of BIM exchange objects was
   developed through ontology-based data mapping of the industry foundation
   classes. The proposed solution further contextualizes syntax per the
   buildingSMART Data Dictionary schema and provides an implementation
   agreement to address the quality issues of discipline BIMs and establish
   consistent modeling and naming conventions to facilitate automated BIM
   data workflow. Findings The level of semantics (LOS) development
   framework and the results of LOS implementation focusing on a building
   mechanical system case project are presented and discussed to showcase
   the increased efficiency resulting from its implementation throughout
   the BIM data management workflows. Originality/value This study
   represents a pioneering effort to create and implement the LOS schema as
   a modularized solution in support of automatic BIM data creation,

Abstract = {It is obvious that the primary document will always be the building
   itself, but within the field of conservation, restoration or maintenance
   it is necessary to have a large documentary archive where the

   requires a lot of time in prior research and which can develop prior
   studies, in addition to the economic cost that it entails. This is why
   with the advancement of technology and digital repositories, digital
   platforms can be created within Heritage Building Information Modeling
   (HBIM). This article reflects the experience of an eight-century-old
   monument, San Juan of Hospital of Valencia (Spain), in which a virtual
   twin has been made with software and specific web platforms in facility
   management such as Archibus (c), EcoDomus (c), Zutec (c) that allow the
   integration of information from BIM models and data acquired through

Title = {Green Building Construction: A Systematic Review of BIM Utilization},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As a multi-function method, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can
   assist construction organizations in improving their project's quality,
   optimize collaboration efficiency, and reduce construction periods and
   expenditure. Given the distinguished contributions of BIM utilization,
   there is a trend that BIM has significant potential to be utilized in
   the construction phase of green buildings. Compared with traditional
   buildings, green buildings have more stringent requirements, including
   environmental protection, saving energy, and residents' comfort.
   Although BIM is deemed an effective method to achieve the abovementioned
   requirements in the construction process of green buildings, there are
   few systematic reviews that explore the capabilities of BIM in the
   construction phase of green buildings. This has hindered the utilization
   of BIM in the construction of green buildings. To bridge this research
   gap and review the latest BIM capabilities, this study was developed to
   perform a systematic review of the BIM capabilities in the construction
   phase of green buildings. In this systematic review, the PRISMA protocol
   has been used as the primary procedure for article screening and review.
   The entire systematic review was performed from January 2022 to April
   2022. In this process, 165 articles were included, reviewed, and
   discussed. Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were adopted as the
   databases. Through this systematic review, it can be identified that BIM
   capabilities have significant advantages in project quality improvement,
   lifecycle data storage and management, collaboration optimization,
   planning, and schedule management optimization in the construction phase
   of green buildings. Through the discussion, it can be concluded that BIM
   utilization can be adopted from the pre-construction phase to the
   post-construction stage in the green building construction process.
   Besides these, the barriers to BIM utilization in the green building
   construction phase are also revealed in the discussion section,
   including the non-uniform data format, insufficient interactivity,
   ambiguous ownership, insufficient BIM training, and hesitation toward
   BIM adoption. Moreover, the challenges and future directions of BIM
   utilization in green building construction are identified. The findings
   of this study can facilitate construction personnel to be acquainted
   with BIM capabilities in the construction of green buildings to promote
   the utilization and optimization of BIM capabilities in the green
   building construction process.},

Title = {I-BIM Applied in Railway Geometric Inspection Activity: Diagnostic and
   Alert},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {The Building Information Modeling (BIM) concept has been recently
   implemented in railway infrastructure, assisting mainly in the project
   elaboration, and further, the facility management aspect. The present
   study addresses the inspection activity of the railway geometry, in a
   BIM context, using a rigorous modeling process of the railway track
   components, and the development of a Dynamo script for the evaluation of
   the degree of geometric irregularity detected during inspection works.
   The monitoring phase of the rail tracks involves a planned railway
   inspection schedule, normally supported by human analyses of data
   collected in a railway geometric inspection. The created script allows
   for evaluating the inspection data and categorizes the data by alert
   levels that are associated with a color code, visualized over the
   railway components of the BIM model. The Dynamo script uses new BIM
   parameters considering the maintenance activity, allowing for analyzing
   inspection data and visualizing the colored alerts. This capacity alerts
   the maintenance engineer about the urgency of planning a retrofitting
   action, according to the severity level of the detected geometric
   anomaly. An illustrative real railway track segment is considered
   supporting the modeling process, the inspection data collection and the
   efficiency analyses of the script application. This research intends to
   contribute to increment knowledge of BIM adoption in railway
   infrastructures, emphasizing the potential of using Dynamo programming
   on BIM model database management.},

Title = {New Perspectives for BIM Usage in Transportation Infrastructure Projects},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Although there is already a great amount of scientific literature
   dealing with the use of building information modeling (BIM) in
   engineering activities, the majority refer to successful case studies
   using the usual methods and technology of building construction but
   rarely bring up the real problems for implementing BIM methodology to
   the field of transportation infrastructure. It must be also considered
   that the construction activity is only a part of the infrastructure life
   and the stakeholder must consider the works of enlargement, renewal, and
   maintenance of the infrastructure. The purpose of this paper is not only
   to show a mere review of the existing literature but also present a
   rational analysis for the use of BIM in different areas of civil
   engineering. For that purpose, the gathered experience in the use of BIM
   in civil engineering projects in the final course of Civil Engineering
   Master Studies in the Civil Engineering School (ETSICCP) at Universidad
   Politecnica de Madrid were compared with the reported literature. This
   way, a complete and updated information regarding tendencies,
   applications, and practice along with limitations and benefits can be
   presented. The significance of this research relies on the original
   insight of BIM for civil engineering applications through four case
   studies. Two of them were focused on construction possibilities and the
   other two on the possibilities in the exploitation, rehabilitation, and
   maintenance. The results showed that despite the lack of previous
   experiences, the use of BIM methodology is possible for activities such
   as maintenance, managing, or expansion of infrastructure by applying
   different specific software packages. Among the main problems needing to
   be addressed are the following: handling of big data files, the
   integration of new data non-related with the modeled object, and
   interchange of data without losing information. That proves the need of
   new more efficient techniques to overcome the challenge of the full use
   of BIM in the civil engineering field and obtain the mutual advantage of
   the co-operation of the academic and industrial worlds.},

Title = {Virtual Tours as Effective Complement to Building Information Models in
   Computer-Aided Facility Management Using Internet of Things},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Featured Application using Virtual Tours (VTs) to complement Building
   Information Models (BIMs) and Internet of Things (IoT) systems as a
   solution for remote control, building automation systems, and other
   tasks involved in Computer-Aided Facility Management (CAFM). The aim is
   to provide contextual access to information and opportunities for
   interaction, simplifying the task of those responsible for managing and
   maintaining building assets.Abstract This study investigates the
   integration of Building Information Models (BIMs) and Virtual Tour (VT)
   environments in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC)
   industry, focusing on Computer-Aided Facility Management (CAFM),
   Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs), and data Life-Cycle
   Assessment (LCA). The interconnected nature of tasks throughout a
   building's life cycle increasingly demands a seamless integration of
   real-time monitoring, 3D models, and building data technologies. While
   there are numerous examples of effective links between IoT and BIMs, as
   well as IoT and VTs, a research gap exists concerning VT-BIM
   integration. This article presents a technical solution that connects
   BIMs and IoT data using VTs to enhance workflow efficiency and
   information transfer. The VT is developed upon a pilot based on the
   Controlled Environments for Living Lab Studies (CELLS), a unique
   facility designed for flexible monitoring and remote-control processes
   that incorporate BIMs and IoT technologies. The findings offer valuable
   insights into the potential of VTs to complement and connect to BIMs
   from a life-cycle perspective, improving the usability of digital twins
   for beginner users and contributing to the advancement of the AEC and
   CAFM industries. Our technical solution helps complete the connectivity
   of BIMs-VT-IoT, providing an intuitive interface (VT) for rapid data
   visualisation and access to dashboards, models and building databases.
   The practical field of application is facility management, enhancing
   monitoring and asset management tasks. This includes (a) sensor data
   monitoring, (b) remote control of connected equipment, and (c)
   centralised access to asset-space information bridging BIM and visual
   (photographic/video) data.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is increasingly used throughout the
   facility's life cycle for various applications, such as design,
   construction, facility management, and maintenance. For existing
   buildings, the geometry of as-built BIM is often constructed using
   dense, three dimensional (3D) point clouds data obtained with laser
   scanners. Traditionally, as-built BIM systems do not contain the
   material and textural information of the buildings' elements. This paper
   presents a semi-automatic method for generation of material and texture
   rich as-built BIM. The method captures and integrates material and
   textural information of building elements into as-built BIM using
   thermal infrared sensing (TIS). The proposed method uses TIS to capture
   thermal images of the interior walls of an existing building. These
   images are then processed to extract the interior walls using a
   segmentation algorithm. The digital numbers in the resulted images are
   then transformed into radiance values that represent the emitted thermal
   infrared radiation. Machine learning techniques are then applied to
   build a correlation between the radiance values and the material type in
   each image. The radiance values were used to extract textural
   information from the images. The extracted textural and material
   information are then robustly integrated into the as-built BIM providing
   the data needed for the assessment of building conditions in general
   including energy efficiency, among others.},

Title = {Lean Management Framework for Healthcare Facilities Integrating BIM,
   BEPS and Big Data Analytics},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {An increase in the usage of information and communication technologies
   (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in Facility Management (FM)
   induces a huge data stack. Even though these data bring opportunities
   such as cost savings, time savings, increase in user comfort, space
   optimization, energy savings, inventory management, etc., these data
   sources cannot be managed and manipulated effectively to increase
   efficiency at the FM stage. In addition to data management issues, FM
   practices, or developed solutions, need to be supported with the
   implementation of lean management philosophy to reveal organizational
   and managerial wastes. In the literature, some researchers performed
   studies about awareness about building information modeling (BIM)-FM,
   and FM-related data management problems in terms of lean philosophy.
   However, the comprehensive solution for effective FM has not been
   investigated with the application of lean management philosophy yet.
   Therefore, this study aims to develop an FM framework for healthcare
   facilities by considering lean management philosophy since more stable
   workflow, continuous improvement, and creating more value to customers
   will help to deliver a more acceptable solution for the FM industry.
   Within this context, the integration of BIM, Building Energy Performance
   Simulations, and Big Data Analytics are proposed as a solution. In the
   study, the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology was followed to
   develop the FM framework. Depending on the DSR methodology, two
   scenarios were used to investigate the issue in a real healthcare
   facility and develop the FM framework. The developed framework was
   evaluated by four experts, and the revisions of the proposed framework
   were realized.},

Title = {From data silos to seamless integration and coordination: a data-asset
   centric approach to smart hospital facility management},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 15},
Abstract = {Purpose - Existing hospital building operations involve numerous
   information technology applications and complex building systems;
   therefore, an intelligent facility management (FM) platform is required
   to ensure their continuous operation. To address the persistent issues
   of data silos, inefficient data interoperability, and workflow
   incoordination that have been identified in the current body of FM
   practice and literature, the present study develops a data-asset (DA)
   centric FM platform specifically designed for hospital buildings.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study proposes a semi-customized
   approach to develop the DA- centric FM platform for hospital buildings.
   To elucidate the precise function requirements of the hospital FM
   platform, focus group interviews are employed. By seamlessly integrating
   the as-built BIM model, IoT sensor data and FM workflow data, the
   BIM-based DA model with a data transfer mechanism is developed. The
   development of the FM platform with function modules in a case study is
   guided by a five-tier architecture and the coordination theory (CT). The
   case study provides an in-depth introduction to the applications of DA
   management, space management and maintenance management modules.
   Findings - The capabilities of the developed DA-centric hospital FM
   platform are validated through the case application and user
   satisfaction survey, which assess data quality, automation level,
   operation efficiency, flexibility and functionality. For hospital FM
   activities, this DA-centric FM platform realizes data integration and
   seamless transformation, optimizes workflow coordination and enhances
   operation performance. Originality/value - The initial scholarly
   contribution is the establishment of the BIM-based DA model, which
   serves as the data middle platform for continuous data integration,
   transmission and sharing within the FM platform. Subsequently, under the
   guidance of the CT, the business process of function modules is
   designed, improving the intra-module and inter-module workflow
   coordination. The developed DA-centric FM system along with its
   performance benchmarking application, assists facility managers and
   decision-makers in implementing smart operations for hospital buildings
   and achieving the management goals of safety, efficiency, energy savings
   and convenience.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the construction
   industry is evolving facility maintenance (FM) towards predictive
   maintenance development. Predictive maintenance of building facilities
   requires continuously updated data on construction components to be
   acquired through integrated sensors. The main challenges in developing
   predictive maintenance tools for building facilities is IoT integration,
   IoT data visualization on the building 3D model and implementation of
   maintenance management system on the IoT and building information
   modeling (BIM). The current 3D building models do not fully interact
   with IoT building facilities data. Data integration in BIM is
   challenging. The research aims to integrate IoT alert systems with BIM
   models to monitor building facilities during the operational phase and
   to visualize building facilities' conditions virtually. To provide
   efficient maintenance services for building facilities this research
   proposes an integration of a digital framework based on IoT and BIM
   platforms. Sensors applied in the building systems and IoT technology on
   a cloud platform with opensource tools and standards enable monitoring
   of real-time operation and detecting of different kinds of faults in
   case of malfunction or failure, therefore sending alerts to facility
   managers and operators. Proposed preventive maintenance methodology
   applied on a proof-of-concept heating, ventilation and air conditioning
   (HVAC) plant adopts open source IoT sensor networks. The results show
   that the integrated IoT and BIM dashboard framework and implemented
   building structures preventive maintenance methodology are applicable
   and promising. The automated system architecture of building facilities
   is intended to provide a reliable and practical tool for real-time data
   acquisition. Analysis and 3D visualization to support intelligent
   monitoring of the indoor condition in buildings will enable the facility
   managers to make faster and better decisions and to improve building
   facilities' real time monitoring with fallouts on the maintenance
   timeliness.},

Abstract = {With the development of information technologies for industrial plants,
   more and more tools for digital design, creation and operation of
   industrial facilities are emerged. In particular, significant success in
   development of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Digital Twin
   technologies (DT) should be noted, which act as tools for digital
   transformation and representation for construction and production
   technologies respectively. In this regard, in this article, the
   principles and methods of integrating BIM and DT technologies within the
   framework of the so-called ``Factories of the Future{''} (FoF) are
   formulated. Wherein the physical twin of FoF includes both production
   technologies and production infrastructure with buildings, structures
   and systems included in it, while particular attention is given to
   Operation and Maintenances (O\&M) stage of object lifecycle which is
   less developed in comparison with design and creation stages. In
   addition, this paper also considers the role of systems information
   modeling (SIM) in such objects. Moreover, the concept of ``digital
   asset{''}, closely related to the FoF, is examined and semantically
   analyzed, especially from information ownership point of view. The
   features of convergence of BIM and DT technologies are analyzed, and the
   levels of development of these technologies are compared. Finally, the
   directions of further research in this interdisciplinary branch of
   researches and development are formulated.},

Abstract = {PurposeAn interaction between emerging technologies (ETs) for facility
   management (FM) activities and stakeholder skills is necessary to
   promote the optimization of FM performance. Previous studies do not show

   competencies of stakeholders. Thus, this study analyzes the interactions
   between ETs and FM from the perceptions of Brazilian professionals,
   identifying the most appropriate and effective technological solutions,
   based on a broad literature review. Design/methodology/approachThe steps
   of the methodology are as follows: systematic literature review (SLR);
   detailing the ETs for FM; online questionnaire based on SLR findings;
   sample of Brazilian FM professionals; statistical treatment; and
   discussion. FindingsResults indicate wireless sensor network, Internet
   of Thing, building information modeling and Big Data as ETs in FM with
   greater potential for optimization in the performance of FM activities,
   from survey respondents. Research limitations/implicationsThe scope of
   possible findings may have been biased, considering the small number of
   research participants and current transformations resulting from the
   COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. changes to standard operating procedures).
   Practical implicationsThe results ensure greater security to facility

Abstract = {The inspection of building components plays a crucial role in reducing
   maintenance costs throughout the building's life cycle. Many buildings
   suffer from defects in the building elements, such as surface problems,
   cracks, and moisture problems. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has
   become a widely used digital tool for the construction industry,
   allowing for the virtual visualization, design, and simulation of
   structures. At the same time, progress in neural networks, a branch of
   artificial intelligence, presents encouraging potential for
   classification and evaluation. This article explores the fusion of BIM
   and neural networks to improve and simplify the building inspection
   procedure. Neural networks are implemented with BIM to conduct real-time
   analysis and predictions as part of an inspection framework. A data set
   consisting of 500 wall samples with defects from different buildings was
   collected through fieldwork. These data were then classified into five
   categories, ranging from D1 (No damage) to D5 (Collapse), based on
   expert opinions. A neural network was used to create a model that can
   show the severity of degradation of building elements. The BIM platform
   is utilized in the implementation of the proposed model to facilitate
   the exchange of information and enhance documentation during inspection.
   The visualization provided by BIM allows the facility management team
   and building owners to assess building elements through causality
   analysis using distinct color codes. A case study of an office building
   is featured in the paper to showcase the application of the proposed
   model for asset management. The color-coded system used in this study
   denotes low-performance conditions as red, medium performance conditions
   as yellow, and high-performance conditions as green. This article
   outlines the procedures for categorizing and ranking defects in building
   elements, specifically focusing on walls.
   This study explores innovative methods for assessing the condition of
   buildings, aiming to improve accuracy, efficiency, and predictive
   capabilities. Traditional building inspections are often subjective,
   time-consuming, and labor-intensive, making it challenging to generate
   consistent and comprehensive evaluations. Our research addresses these
   limitations by integrating BIM and neural networks. BIM provides
   detailed digital models of buildings, which include comprehensive
   information about each component. This technology enables precise and
   consistent assessments, reducing the subjectivity inherent in manual
   inspections. Neural networks, a type of artificial intelligence, can
   analyze complex data patterns and detect potential issues early,
   allowing for proactive maintenance. By combining these two technologies,
   our approach offers a more efficient and objective method for building
   condition assessment. This integration not only saves time and resources
   but also enhances the ability to predict and prevent future issues,
   ultimately extending the lifespan of building components and improving
   overall building performance. These advancements are particularly
   relevant for property managers, maintenance teams, and construction
   professionals seeking to optimize building maintenance and management
   practices. The findings of this study can significantly benefit the
   construction and facilities management industries by providing a more
   reliable and advanced method for maintaining building health and safety,
   thereby ensuring sustainable and cost-effective building management.},

Title = {Interactive Holograms for Construction Coordination and Quantification},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},

Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Advancements in information technology in the architecture, engineering,
   construction, and operations (AECO) industry have led to the deployment
   of building information modeling (BIM) throughout the life cycle of
   buildings. BIM represents a collaborative and information-rich
   environment that can be used in the design, construction, and facility
   management phases of a project. BIM can also be used to visualize the
   construction project as an immersive environment using virtual and
   augmented reality. Similar environments can be developed using game
   engines to further elaborate on the information embedded in a building
   information model. This study presents a new visualization technique for
   building information models and interactive holograms and validates
   their effectiveness through an experimental study. A plugin to automate
   the transfer of models into game engines, software to enable intuitive
   interaction with the hologram using hand gestures and voice commands,
   and a display platform that allows the visualization of the hologram
   were developed. The results of the study showed that the developed
   plugin is more effective than traditional methods used to export
   building models from modeling platforms into a gaming environment.
   Moreover, the interactive hologram was determined to be user-friendly
   and a good learning tool for construction management education. The
   developed technologies enhance the BIM-data, human-building, and
   human-human levels of interaction necessary for a successful BIM
   visualization environment and make a collaborative visualization tool
   available to construction project teams for more effective
   communication. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Title = {A BIM-based framework for operation and maintenance of utility tunnels},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {97},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Underground utility tunnels are crucial for urban areas with high
   density in both population and number of buildings since they can
   tremendously improve the utilization of land resources. However, the
   operation \& maintenance (O\&M) of such underground tunnels is tedious
   and challenging, due to the fact that there is a lack of effective
   information technologies to facilitate O\&M of utility tunnels. Although
   Building information modelling (BIM) technology is asserted to provide a
   game-changing solution to address the challenges encountered in the AEC
   industry, the use of BIM for operating and managing utility facilities
   in an efficient manner is rarely explored in the existing literature. To
   address this gap, a novel framework is proposed in this research to
   promote the sustainable O\&M of utility tunnels with the support of BIM.
   Specifically, this framework encompasses three modules, namely, BIM
   model, O\&M database, and monitoring system. A detailed description of
   each component of the proposed framework, as well as a preliminary user
   interface design, is presented in this paper. An implementation example
   is presented to provide the validation of the proposed framework. The
   preliminary results indicate the feasibility of the proposed framework
   in facilitating the information integration and communication of utility
   tunnels. This research contributes to the main body of knowledge by
   proposing a generic BIM framework for sustainable O\&M of utility
   tunnels and formalizing data requirements as well as management workflow
   intended for utility tunnel O\&M.},

Abstract = {In this study, our aim is to present a comprehensive systematic review
   on digitalization (DT) in facility management (FM) and FM performance
   management (PM). Past research on these themes indicated that either
   research articles on DT in FM or research studies on FM PM are
   separately dealt with. However, in contrast, in our literature review,
   we try to present a holistic literature review by integrating both
   research streams on DT applications for FM and FM PM. A total 130
   academic journal articles published on these subjects, between 1990 and
   2021, from Web of Science and Google Scholars, were reviewed in this
   article. Moreover, this article identified a number of possibilities for
   future research on DT and FM PM, including the interoperability
   enhancement of building information modeling (BIM) methodology, the test
   and implementation of BIM concept for smart transportation
   infrastructure, usage of the integration of 3D analysis algorithms, the
   perfect cross integration of BIM and geographic information system (GIS)
   and systematic research efforts with new methodologies and theoretical
   constructs. We hope that this article will help researchers determine
   the areas where further research must be conducted and what kind of
   future directions would be valuable for DT and PM in FM.},

Title = {Employer's Information Requirements: A Case Study Implementation of BIM
   on the Example of Selected Construction Projects in Poland},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Case studies available in the literature clearly point to the numerous
   benefits of BIM (Building Information Modeling), in addition to the
   barriers that participants of such projects may face. This paper is a
   case study of Employer's Information Requirements (EIR) for preparing
   and managing BIM models in the design and construction of selected large
   public construction projects: the Cogiteon Lesser Poland Science Center
   (LPSC Cogiteon), the Krakow Music Center (KMC) and the Copernican
   Revolution Studio (CRS). The paper presents the main aspects included in
   EIRs. It discusses the technical (e.g., requirements for the Common Data
   Environment platform-CDE), management (including the scopes of
   responsibility of staff in charge of BIM) and strategic sections
   (primary expectations concerning Data Drops) of the EIR. Projects
   executed using BIM by public institutions allow for the application of
   insight gained as a result of their completion and the creation of a
   knowledge base or checklist for future projects. The projects discussed
   here, carried out using advanced BIM solutions, could potentially be
   developed further by the proposed content extension concerning levels of
   detail (this paper cites potential guidelines that can be applied),
   component elements concerning price and qualifications, so as to easily
   generate bills of costs, and information used in facility management
   which can also encourage facility manager cooperation. Examples of EIR
   provisions are presented based on an analysis of three completed
   construction projects carried out using advanced BIM solutions. BIM is
   still a new form of management and this paper expands the range of
   available EIR standards, in addition to presenting guidelines for their
   practical application in the construction industry.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This article describes an innovative methodology for remote inspection
   of reinforced concrete (RC) structures using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
   (UAVs) and based on advanced digital image processing. The use of
   specific heuristic feature-extraction methods, developed in MATLAB(C),
   allows the automatic identification of various types of RC pathologies,
   particularly, biological colonies, efflorescences, cracks and exposed
   steel rebars. The developed inspection methodology is applied to the
   Monte da Virgem telecommunications tower, which has a total height of
   177 m and is the highest structure of this kind in Portugal. The results
   demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the methodology in: i) its
   ability to accurately locate and characterize the existing pathologies,
   ii) visualizing the full extent of pathologies in 3D photogrammetric
   reconstitutions of the structure, and iii) integrating the identified
   pathologies into a Building Information Modeling (BIM) model. The
   regular use of the proposed methodology over time will allow accurate
   monitoring of the evolution of pathologies to assess the condition of
   the structure. Additionally, the integration of the inspection results
   into BIM digital models will help infrastructure managers to decide on
   the implementation of the most adequate facility management strategies
   in order to optimize the scheduling of maintenance, rehabilitation and
   retrofitting interventions.},

Abstract = {This work represents a paradigm shift in the approach to manage port
   infrastructure maintenance where the use of the building information
   modeling (BIM) method is very scarce, and it is now beginning. The new
   infrastructure conservation management method proposed in this
   manuscript combines traditional methods with new technology, covering
   the gap of the implementation of BIM in port maintenance. This new
   technology is the BIM method, and its use is already mandatory in public
   infrastructure projects in some countries. In this work, the BIM method
   is applied to the management of the conservation of port infrastructures
   to show the benefits that can be obtained using it. After the analysis
   of the state of the art in the conservation of port infrastructures, two
   of the main maritime works of the Outer Port of A Coruna were modeled in
   Revit. This as-built model serves as an inventory model and forms a
   large database of all the information regarding the conservation of the
   structures. In this way, all the data on the conservation of the port's
   infrastructures are concentrated in a single source of information in
   which, in addition, there is a three-dimensional and georeferenced
   representation of the port in question. The main finding of this work is
   the development of a step by step method to implement BIM philosophy in
   port maintenance, highlighting the positive and negative points detected
   during the validation of the method in a real case, detecting future
   improvement research lines. Although BIM has a lot of advantages and
   possibilities just now, some improvements are still necessary.},

Abstract = {A smart city digital twin refers to a system designed to digitally
   replicate real-world city objects in a virtual space and implement
   real-time synchronization with the real world, thus helping to solve
   urban problems through various service scenario simulations and data
   analysis processes. In relation to the development of city information
   models for implementing the smart city digital twin, many efforts have
   been made to integrate and utilize BIM-GIS data. However, due to
   problems with the capacity available for storing large amounts of data,
   there are limitations in practical applications because it is sometimes
   difficult to provide numerous realtime services in the era of web
   environments. Therefore, in this study, a lightweighting process for the
   Lightweight Digital Twin System was presented as a method to provide
   various services that a smart city offers based on the digital twin, and
   a lightweighting method was proposed accordingly. The process and method
   were verified through the development of a case application for the case
   of 00 city. It is expected that the Digital Twin System lightweighting
   method proposed in this study will serve as a basis for efficient city
   information processing and contribute to facilitating the provision of
   various smart city-related services.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) of higher education (HE) buildings
   significantly impacts the built environment sector. This research aimed
   to optimize learning environments and enhance student comfort,
   especially post-COVID-19. The study adopts the principles of
   Post-occupancy Evaluation (POE) to collect and analyze various
   quantitative and qualitative data through environmental data monitoring,
   a user perceptions survey, and semi-structured interviews with
   professionals. Although the environmental conditions generally met
   existing standards, the findings indicated opportunities for further
   improvements to better support university communities' comfort and
   health. A significant challenge identified by this research is the
   inability of the facility management to physically manage and operate
   the vast and complex spaces within HE buildings with contemporary IEQ
   standards. In response to these findings, this research developed a
   BIM-based prototype for the real-time monitoring and automated control
   of IEQ. The prototype integrates a BIM model with Arduino-linked
   sensors, motors, and traffic lights, with the latter visually indicating
   IEQ status, while motors automatically adjust environmental conditions
   based on sensor inputs. The outcomes of this study not only contribute
   to the ongoing discourse on sustainable building management, especially
   post-pandemic, but also demonstrate an advancement in the application of
   BIM technologies to improve IEQ and by extension, occupant wellbeing in
   HE buildings.},

Title = {Augmented Reality to Enable Users to Identify Deviations for Model
   Reconciliation},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Effective use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) during operation
   typically requires modeled content to accurately match the built spaces,
   which necessitates effective field verification techniques to ensure
   that BIM content matches the actual built conditions. Some contractors
   leverage laser scanning and other reality-capture technologies to verify
   modeled content prior to turnover, but these approaches can be time- and
   resource-intensive. Augmented reality (AR) enables users to view BIM
   content overlaid on their field of view of the built space. Research
   suggests potential for using AR for tasks related to field verification,
   but a study that systematically explores the specific types of
   deviations that can be detected with this technology is missing from the
   current literature. This paper tasks participants with using immersive
   AR to identify deviations from BIM in a ceiling plenum space that
   includes installed Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) components,
   which would typically be included in a coordinated BIM. The results
   suggest that AR can enable users to effectively identify large
   deviations and missing building elements. However, the results do not
   indicate that AR effectively enables users to identify small deviations
   and can potentially lead to identifying false positive observations,
   where accurately constructed elements are perceived as deviating from
   BIM. These results suggest that immersive AR can effectively be used to
   check whether recently built elements conform to the intended BIM in
   instances where speed of verification is more important than adhering to
   strict tolerances. For instances where accuracy (less than two inches)
   is critical, the results of this work suggest that AR can be used to
   help determine where in the building more accurate, but more
   resource-intensive, reality-capture technologies should be used.},

Abstract = {In the past, knowledge in the fields of Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction (AEC) industries mainly come from experiences and are
   documented in hard copies or specific electronic databases. In order to
   make use of this knowledge, a lot of studies have focused on retrieving
   and storing this knowledge in a systematic and accessible way. The
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology proves to be a valuable
   media in extracting data because it provides physical and functional
   digital models for all the facilities within the life-cycle of the
   project. Therefore, the combination of the knowledge science with BIM
   shows great potential in constructing the knowledge map in the field of
   the AEC industry. Based on literature reviews, this article summarizes
   the latest achievements in the fields of knowledge science and BIM, in
   the aspects of (1) knowledge description, (2) knowledge discovery, (3)
   knowledge storage and management, (4) knowledge inference and (5)
   knowledge application, to show the state-of-arts and suggests the future
   directions in the application of knowledge science and BIM technology in
   the fields of AEC industries. The review indicates that BIM is capable
   of providing information for knowledge extraction and discovery, by
   adopting semantic network, knowledge graph and some other related
   methods. It also illustrates that the knowledge is helpful in the
   design, construction, operation and maintenance periods of the AEC
   industry, but now it is only at the beginning stage.},

Abstract = {PurposeFacility management (FM) is regarded as an emerging issue in
   civil engineering and is responsible for ensuring the building's
   expected performance. The purpose of this study is to analyze buildings'
   current FM processes for educational and high residential segments and
   propose an FM-building information modeling (BIM) (BIM6D) to understand
   the information flow and leading players with and without FM-BIM
   integration. Design/methodology/approachThe research strategy was a case
   study with data from the FM process of two buildings. This study was
   carried out in three stages: diagnosis of FM of the two buildings,
   FM-BIM integration and information flow and leading players analysis.
   Maintenance activities were categorized according to periodicity and
   status criteria for each project element for FM-BIM integration and were
   visualized in the Revit design using Dynamo software. FindingsThe
   results of this study show differences in how FM is conducted,
   especially in formalization and preventive character, and similarities
   regarding the difficulty of foreseen and lack of control because of
   scattered, disconnected and incomplete information on both. The visual
   appeal of the FM-BIM integration facilitates information access. It
   optimizes the use of the digital model through the most prolonged phase
   of the life cycle of a building (post-occupation phase). However, FM-BIM
   challenges buildings that do not have digital model expertise as
   residential segments. This study suggests a more significant role for
   construction companies in these cases. Originality/valueThis study
   investigates BIM-FM integration of buildings in two different contexts
   and reveals the importance of a construction company's role in buildings
   in the residential segment. This study contributes with real-life cases
   on BIM in existing buildings, discussing the value and challenges of BIM
   in FM applications.},

Title = {Modeling indoor thermal comfort in buildings using digital twin and
   machine learning},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Digital Twin (DT) concept is used in different domains and industries,
   including the building industry, as it has physical and digital assets
   with the help of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Technologies and
   methodologies constantly enrich the building industry because the amount
   of data generated during different building stages is considerable and
   has a tremendous effect on the lifecycle of a building. Previous
   research underscores the importance of seamlessly exchanging information
   between physical and digital assets within a comprehensive framework,
   particularly emphasizing the integration of BIM data with various
   systems to enhance efficiency and prevent information loss. Despite
   advancements in technologies, challenges persist in optimizing methods
   for integrating BIM data into DT frameworks, including ensuring
   interoperability, scalability, and real-time monitor and control. This
   study addresses this research gap by proposing a comprehensive platform
   that integrates the DT concept with IoT and BIM technologies. The
   platform is developed in five main stages: 1) acquiring electronic data
   of the building from the laser scanner, 2) developing a Wi-Fi IoT module
   and BIM data for physical assets and digital replica, 3) constructing
   the DT elements of the platform, 4) performing data analysis 5)
   implementing thermal comfort prediction models. Two machine learning
   models (Facebook prophet, NeuralProphet) are implemented to predict
   thermal comfort. The best predictive model is identified by evaluating
   its error function using historical training data collected during
   facility operation. A case study demonstrates the practical application
   of the proposed framework. The case study involves a real building where
   the platform is implemented to monitor and control indoor environments.
   By utilizing predefined data in BIM models, the platform ensures data
   accuracy, consistency, and usability. The case outputs reveal that
   Neuralprophet provides good prediction results.},

Abstract = {The increasing global influence of FM in higher education institutions
   (HEIs) reported in the literature necessitates a comprehensive
   examination of the research landscape, with emphasis on how facility
   management (FM) plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of
   teaching, learning, and research environments. This study provides an
   analysis of the research landscape of FM within HEIs. Using the PRISMA
   approach to analyze 428 documents from the Scopus (TM) database, this
   paper employs a combination of bibliometric analysis, systematic
   literature review, and meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive
   examination of FM research trends and key themes. This study reveals a
   significant increase in publications in the field of FM research over
   the past three decades, emphasizing its growing significance in
   fostering efficient and sustainable learning environments. The
   significant role of effective FM practices in enhancing student
   satisfaction, academic performance, and institutional reputation was
   emphasized. Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) (viz., thermal comfort,
   air quality, lighting, and acoustics) is crucial for the well-being and
   productivity of building occupants. The integration of FM with building
   information modeling (BIM), smart campus technologies, and
   sustainability initiatives has improved operational efficiency and
   environmental sustainability. This study underscores the importance of
   allocating resources for facility maintenance and professional services
   and implementing advanced technologies and sustainable practices in FM
   for HEIs to create a conducive academic environment. This study provides
   beneficial insights for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners

Title = {Multidimensional behavioral responses to the implementation of BIM in
   construction projects: an empirical study in China},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {2},
Pages = {819-841},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Purpose Despite its great potential to improve the sustainability of
   architectural, engineering, construction and facility management
   activities, the implementation of building information modeling (BIM) in
   many projects has failed to achieve expected benefits due to negative
   behavioral responses such as user resistance. This paper aims to
   characterize the complexity of end user's behavioral responses to BIM
   implementation in construction projects using a multidimensional
   perspective and examines how these responses are impacted by different
   levels of contextual factors. Design/methodology/approach By integrating
   technology acceptance, resistance and adoption literature, this paper
   theoretically proposes a research model to characterize the associations
   between different dimensions of behavioral responses and different
   levels of contextual factors. The model is then empirically tested with
   survey and interview data collected from BIM-based construction projects
   in China. Findings The empirical results not only validate the
   two-dimensional view of the behavioral responses (i.e. the dimension of
   support/resistance that ranges from aggressive resistance to
   enthusiastic support, and the dimension of actual use that ranges from
   non-use to high use) but also provide evidence for the prevalence of
   ambivalent responses such as supporting but lowly using and resisting
   but highly using. The empirical results also provide evidence that
   different levels of contextual factors generally play different roles in
   shaping the behavioral responses. Specifically, the dimension of
   support/resistance is more substantially impacted by the team-level
   factor while the dimension of actual use of BIM is more significantly
   associated with the project-level factor. Originality/value While
   previous research on BIM adoption or implementation behaviors has
   primarily focused on investigating users' response from single-dimension
   perspectives such as acceptance or non-acceptance, this study represents
   an exploratory effort of using a two-dimensional view to characterize
   the complexity and ambivalence of end users' behavioral responses to the
   implementation of innovative technologies such as BIM in construction
   projects. This study also contributes to deepened understandings of how
   these different dimensions of behavioral responses are intricately
   shaped by different levels (i.e. individual-, team- and project-levels)
   of contextual factors in construction projects which are characterized
   as temporary and inter-organizational.},

Title = {Geometry and Topology Reconstruction of BIM Wall Objects from
   Photogrammetric Meshes and Laser Point Clouds},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {As the foundation for digitalization, building information modeling
   (BIM) technology has been widely used in the field of architecture,
   engineering, construction, and facility management (AEC/FM). Unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV) oblique photogrammetry and laser scanning have
   become increasingly popular data acquisition techniques for surveying
   buildings and providing original data for BIM modeling. However, the
   geometric and topological reconstruction of solid walls, which are among
   the most important architectural structures in BIM, is still a
   challenging undertaking. Due to noise and missing data in 3D point
   clouds, current research mostly focuses on segmenting wall planar
   surfaces from unstructured 3D point clouds and fitting the plane
   parameters without considering the thickness or 3D shape of the wall.
   Point clouds acquired only from the indoor space are insufficient for
   modeling exterior walls. It is also important to maintain the
   topological relationships between wall objects to meet the needs of
   complex BIM modeling. Therefore, in this study, a geometry and topology
   modeling method is proposed for solid walls in BIM based on
   photogrammetric meshes and laser point clouds. The method uses a kinetic
   space-partitioning algorithm to generate the building footprint and
   indoor floor plan. It classifies interior and exterior wall segments and
   infers parallel line segments to extract wall centerlines. The
   topological relationships are reconstructed and maintained to build wall
   objects with consistency. Experimental results on two datasets,
   including both photogrammetric meshes and indoor laser point clouds,
   exhibit more than 90\% completeness and correctness, as well as
   centimeter-level accuracy of the wall surfaces.},

Title = {IFC plus : Towards the integration of IoT into early stages of building
   design},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {136},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies into Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) provides significant opportunities to
   support useful services and functionalities for end users in buildings,
   enabling socalled smart spaces (e.g. smart buildings and smart homes).
   Current approaches perform this integration to access the deployed IoT
   devices once the building is constructed using Building Automation
   Systems (BAS), Building Information Systems (BIS) and Building Control
   Systems (BCS). Thus, the integration of IoT devices into the early
   stages of building design to describe IoT scenarios and IoT practices is
   still neglected, despite the benefits it can provide by being involved
   in the entire building lifecycle, e.g. cost estimation, stronger
   facility management, collaborative approach, simplification of tasks for
   developers/programmers through the integration with BIS, BAS and BCS,
   and a more holistic management of the IoT infrastructure.
   This paper presents a solution to integrate IoT into the design stage
   (modelling) of buildings in BIM processes, through two main
   contributions: Industry Foundation Classes Plus (IFC+), an extension to
   the latest version of IFC where new types of entities have been added to
   support the modelling of IoT scenarios; and a digital object based
   approach to transform smart-built environment specifications in IFC+
   into consumable software, with the aim of supporting IoT scenarios. This
   paper illustrates the applicability of the proposed method in the
   context of design processes, the metamodel (schema) of IFC+, the
   proposed approach, and a proof of concept with a clarifying use case.},

   Planning and Building Design},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {148845-148861},
Abstract = {Site planning and building design results are generally managed in
   Geographic Information System (GIS) and Building Information
   Modeling/Model (BIM) separately. The incompatibility of data has brought
   potential challenges for the assessment and delivery of the results. A
   data integration and simplification framework for improving site
   planning and building design is proposed in this paper. A BIM-GIS
   integrated model with a multi-scale data structure is developed to link
   the results of site planning and building design together. Geometric
   optimization algorithms are then designed to generate simplified
   building models with different levels of details (LODs) based on the
   information required at each scale. This paper provides a feasible way
   to integrate planning and design data from different sources to enhance
   the evaluation and delivery of the results. The proposed approach is
   validated by a village construction project in east China, and results
   show that the method is capable to integrate site planning and building
   design results from different platforms and support seamless
   visualization of multi-scale geometric data. It is also found that a
   seamless database facilitates understanding of planning and design
   results and improves communication efficiency. Currently, the main
   limitation of this paper is the limited access to 3D real-world data,
   and data collection techniques like point cloud are expected to solve
   the problem.},

   ``Urban Abacus of Building Energy Performances (Abaco Urbano

   crux of the AUREE project is a Web-GIS GeoBlog portal with customized

   environment and promoting the participation of local stakeholders in its
   improvement. As the latest development of this research, a workflow that
   integrates the AUREE portal with BIM authoring and an open-source IoT
   platform is implemented and applied to an experimental case study
   concerning a public building in Carbonia (Italy). The headquarters of
   the Sotacarbo Sustainable Energy Research Center was selected as the
   case study. The presented results proved that it was possible to create
   a valid open system, which was accessible to both specialist and
   unskilled users, and aimed at guiding, through a progressive knowledge
   deepening, common end-users toward proper conscious ``energy

   toward sustainable facility management. Later, the proposed open system
   could also be suitable to be used as an effective tool to support the

   offered to the user. Design/methodology/approach A model is developed to
   use the quantities exported from a BIM platform, then generate
   construction activities, calculate the duration of each activity and
   finally the logic/sequence is applied in order to link the activities
   together. Then, multiobjective optimization is performed using
   nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) in order to provide the
   most feasible solutions considering project duration and cost. The
   researchers opted NSGA-II because it is one of the well-known and
   credible algorithms that have been used in many applications, and its
   performances were tested in several comparative studies. Findings The
   proposed model is capable to select the near-optimum scenario for the
   project and export it to Primavera software. A case study is worked to
   demonstrate the use of the proposed model and illustrate its main
   features. Originality/value The proposed model can provide a simple and
   user-friendly model for automated schedule generation of construction
   projects. In addition, opportunities related to the interface between an
   automated schedule generation model and Primavera software are enabled
   as Primavera is one of the most popular and common schedule software
   solutions in the construction industry. Furthermore, it allows importing
   data from MS Excel, which is used to store activities data in the
   different scenarios. In addition, there are numerous solutions, each one
   corresponds to a certain duration and cost according to the performance
   factor which often reflects the number of crews assigned to the activity
   and/or construction method.},

   Using Point Clouds and Building Information Modelling (BIM)},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Technological developments involving the implementation of modern
   measuring equipment and the digitalisation of civil engineering can
   contribute to extending the service life of buildings. Large-panel
   buildings constitute a large housing stock throughout Europe. This paper
   presents the possibility of using laser scanning to identify typical
   assembly defects in large-panel buildings. Based on point cloud data,
   numerical models were created to assess the impact of improper assembly
   on the elements' performance. It was indicated that using scanning to
   identify and monitor the displacement of structural elements does not
   relieve experts of the need to perform other tests. Analyses related to
   the possibility of using Building Information Modeling technology to
   manage large-panel buildings were also conducted. A parametric model was
   made, from which a number of possibilities of its use at every stage of
   the building's life were presented in an example. It was highlighted
   that parametric models of large-panel buildings, due to their repeatable
   geometry, can be copied for use in managing entire neighbourhoods.
   Limitations associated with implementing BIM technology in practice were
   also formulated. The analyses and research performed confirm the
   validity of implementing modern research methods in engineering practice
   and digitising the documentation of large-panel buildings.},

Title = {Graph neural network-based spatio-temporal indoor environment prediction
   and optimal control for central air-conditioning systems},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {242},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Model-based optimal control has proven its effectiveness in optimizing
   the performance of central airconditioning systems in terms of thermal
   comfort and energy efficiency. It was often assumed that temperature
   distribution in the entire air-conditioned space is uniform and can be
   represented by a single or averaged measurement in optimization.
   However, actual distribution in the air-conditioned space is usually
   uneven, which can affect thermal comfort and indoor air quality. The
   dynamics of air conditioning systems and their interactions with the
   built environment exist in both time and space domains. Conventional
   data-driven approaches typically concentrate on the temporal
   correlations only among building operation data, while neglecting the
   spatial correlations. This study proposed a spatio-temporal data-driven
   methodology for optimal control of central air conditioning systems,
   which aims to address the challenging issue of uneven spatial
   distributions of environmental parameters in air-conditioned space. The
   methodology consists of graph-based multisource data integration, graph
   neural network-based indoor environment modeling and spatio-temporal
   modelbased online optimal control. The proposed methodology is tested on
   real air handling unit-variable air volume (AHU-VAV) system in a
   high-rise office building through a cloud-based platform.
   Spatio-temporal data from building automation system (BAS), internet of
   things (IoT) devices and building information modeling (BIM) are
   integrated and organized as graph structure. Graph neural network models
   are developed for predicting the evolution of indoor air temperature
   distribution under different control settings. The developed graph
   neural network-recurrent neural network (GNN-RNN) model architectures
   show enhanced accuracy than conventional deep learning models (i.e.,
   convolutional neural network-recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN),
   Dense-RNN). And the cloud-based online test demonstrates that the
   proposed model-based control strategy improves the percentage of time
   achieving Grade I thermal comfort from 36.5\% (i.e., existing control
   strategy) to 81.3\%.},

Abstract = {Automotive industries require constant technological development and the
   capacity to adapt to market needs. Hence, component suppliers must be
   able to adapt to persistent trend changes and technical improvements,
   acting in response to customers' expectations and developing their
   manufacturing methods to be as flexible as possible. Concepts such as
   layout flexibility, management of industrial facilities, and building
   information modeling (BIM) are becoming ever more addressed within the
   automotive industry in order to envision and select the necessary
   information exchanges. Given this question and based on the gap in the
   literature regarding this subject, this work proposes a solution,
   developing a novel tool that allows the monitoring and assignment of
   newer/relocated equipment to the switchboards within a given industrial
   plant. The solution intends to increase the flexibility of production
   lines through the assessment, analysis, improvement, and reorganization
   of the electrical load distribution to develop projects accurately
   implying layout changes. The tool is validated with an automotive
   manufacturer. With the implementation of this open-source tool, a
   detailed electrical flow management system is accomplished, and it has
   proven successful and essential in raising levels of organizational
   flexibility. This has guaranteed the company's competitiveness with
   effective integrated administration methods and tools, such as a much
   easier study upon inserting new/relocated equipment without production
   line breaks.},

Title = {Semantics-based connectivity graph for indoor pathfinding powered by
   IFC-Graph},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {171},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Pathfinding is important for many indoor location-based applications
   such as facility management and indoor navigation. Conventional
   approaches for constructing indoor networks for pathfinding are mostly
   based on geometry processing, which can be computing-intensive and
   time-consuming, especially for buildings with complex irregular shapes.
   In addition, the generated geometric networks often lack semantics. This
   paper proposes a new semantics-based approach for constructing navigable
   indoor networks. This approach uses the rich semantic information from
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) in the form of IFC-Graph (i.e., a
   graph-based representation of building information developed in a prior
   study) so as to meet the needs of indoor pathfinding. Real-world
   building models are used to validate the proposed approach. The results
   show that 1) the semantics-based approach has advantages in
   object-to-object pathfinding such as space-to-space, space-to-exit, and
   space-to-facility, 2) the use of graph technology makes it flexible to
   add semantic information to the network to better support pathfinding
   applications. The semantics-based approach can fit into digital twin
   technology and integrate with augmented reality.},

Abstract = {This paper delves into the integration of Factories of the Future (FoF)
   and digital twin technologies within urban contexts, marking a
   significant leap in Smart Cities development. We present a thorough
   exploration of the principles and a scientifically grounded framework
   designed for seamlessly blending advanced manufacturing systems with the
   urban environment's digital and physical aspects. Our detailed analysis
   has identified core principles crucial for this integration, focusing on
   interoperability, sustainability, adaptability, stakeholder

   framework that puts these principles into action, outlining strategic
   routes for incorporating digital twin and Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) technologies into FoF, establishing public-private partnerships,
   enhancing education and workforce development, and setting up mechanisms
   for ongoing evaluation and enhancement. The potential of this
   integration to transform urban development is vast, providing a model
   for boosting operational efficiency, driving economic growth, and
   enhancing urban livability. Although challenges exist in realizing this
   vision, our research offers practical insights and strategies for cities

   large public organization to understand the challenges of their current
   FM processes and the steps required in developing an asset information
   model (AIM) from a project information model (PIM). A mixed method
   approach was employed with interviews, document analysis and an
   exploratory pilot case study.
   Findings - This paper investigates the process, the challenges and the
   level of effort of the information commissioning process to create a
   fit-for-use ACM. Four distinct steps were identified in the process as
   follows: analyzing the handover PIM and documents, extracting
   FM-specific information, populating the model with the information and
   attaching operations and maintenance (O\&M) documents. The research
   highlights the significant amount of effort that is required when no
   specific asset information requirements are formulated at the project
   onset.
   Practical implications - The paper presents an information commissioning
   pitrPss that helps to develop an ATM from a PIM. Understanding the
   impact of the lack of requirements on the information commissioning
   process can help asset owners understand the importance of defining and
   articulating their information requirements up front.
   Originality/value - This paper provides empirical evidence of the impact
   of the absence of formal information requirements on the development of
   a fit-for-use AIM.},

Title = {SEAMLESS AUGMENTED REALITY REGISTRATION SUPPORTING FACILITY MANAGEMENT
   OPERATIONS IN UNPREPARED ENVIRONMENTS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {1156-1180},
Abstract = {Despite its great potential, Augmented Reality (AR) still struggles to
   be widely used in real processes in the construction industry. This is
   mainly due to limitations associated with current AR registration
   methodologies, including the lack of continuity between different
   scenarios, drifts over distances, and the need to prepare the scene in
   advance with alignment infrastructures and to resort to manual
   registration procedures. In addition, users may not be skilled enough or
   allowed to prepare the considered environment, since this is a task that
   requires a significant amount of measurement and calibration. To promote
   the application of AR in Facility Management (FM), which typically
   involves both complex indoor and outdoor environments, an automatic
   localization method is needed, thus providing accurate AR registration
   in mixed and unprepared environments. In order to fill this gap, a
   system implementing a markerless approach for seamless indoor-outdoor AR
   registration has been developed by integrating multiple AR registration
   engines with a cloud platform. These engines, primarily relying on
   Global Navigation Satellite Systems Real-Time Kinematic (GNSS-RTK) and
   Computer Vision (CV) technologies, are managed by an additional system
   component that automatically assigns priority depending on the current
   scenario. The system proposed in this study is tested on site on an FM
   use case related to a university campus for qualitative assessment.
   Furthermore, a quantitative assessment of the systems' accuracy is also
   performed. In both evaluations, the system shows very promising results
   in terms of (i) applicability for FM operations, and (ii) accuracy.
   Specifically, BIM holograms are automatically superimposed to their real
   counterparts seamlessly, in mixed indoor-outdoor scenarios, without
   manual procedures, demonstrating applicability of the proposed approach
   in unprepared environments. In terms of accuracy, the AR overlaying
   discrepancies in outdoor and indoor scenarios (DL-SQ) result equals
   0.090 m and 0.082 m with a maximum among all the analyzed scenes (DM) of
   0.075 m and 0.071 m , respectively. Given these results, the work
   presented in this paper provides a substantial contribution to the
   dissemination ofAR technologies in the FMfield and to the support of FM
   activities in terms of better coordination, visualization, communication
   and on-field access to high-quality information. This paper extends the
   work presented at the 23rd International Conference on Construction
   Applications of Virtual Reality (CONVR 2023).},

Abstract = {It is necessary to ensure safety in terms of health and accidents
   through the real-time monitoring of the construction site environment
   and workers. This problem has become of great importance due to the
   economic and social implications. Therefore, a sensor-based approach has
   been found to be beneficial in Building Information Modeling (BIM).
   Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies are well-suited for the
   deployment of monitoring systems. A suitable technical solution for node
   communication in a WSN is Long Range (LoRa) modulation technology. In
   this study, an autonomous LoRa-based system for the monitoring of a
   construction site in Lungro, Calabria, Italy, is presented. The spatial
   monitoring of working personnel is achieved by employing a tracker
   device with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a Global Positioning
   System (GPS) device. Accesses of personnel and gear to the site are
   registered using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags equipped
   with protective gear. Fixed-position solar-powered sensor nodes are also
   employed for structural monitoring, i.e., movement sensors are used to
   monitor the variation of scaffolding, building structures, and
   under-work housing inclinations. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN)
   gateways interface with the nodes and the internet for data exchange,
   enabling an Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm for the monitoring
   solution. A comprehensive overview of the workers and structural nodes,
   along with the RFID access management system and LoRaWAN gateway
   features, is provided in this article. A description of the web
   interface is also reported.},

Abstract = {In the maintenance domain of the construction industry, digital twins
   have been actively introduced based on the technologies of the Fourth
   Industrial Revolution with growing interest in three-dimensional spatial
   information facility management and disaster response service using
   digital twin technology. In particular, disasters or abnormal situations
   in an underground utility tunnel (UTU) can cause serious casualties and
   property damage since key elements of a city such as power,
   communications, water supply, and heating facilities are collectively
   accommodated in a certain underground space. This study established the
   methodology for implementing an underground utility tunnel through a
   digital twin. The novelty of this study is demonstrating a sequential
   procedure of implementing digital twin technology by configuring major
   layers such as data acquisition, modeling, and service. This methodology
   can serve as reference material or a training aid for implementing a
   digital twin of underground facilities or underground utility tunnels in
   the future; the proposed methodology will be verified when an actual
   digital twin service is provided.},

Title = {A Unified Database Solution to Process BIM and GIS Data},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {For many years, the objective of spatial databases created using
   Geographic Information System (GIS) technology was to provide
   information about large spaces and areas outside of buildings. Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) technology focused mainly on small spaces,
   indoor and outdoor, targeted at other users and slightly different
   applications, was developed simultaneously for several dozen years. The
   significant development of GIS technology and new tools for quick data
   acquisition (e.g., laser scanning) and growing user needs resulted in
   the geoinformation modeling of the space inside buildings as well. BIM,
   on the other hand, began to be used for increasingly larger spaces
   outside buildings. Technology developers, users, and scientists started
   to notice that works turned out to be repetitive and that combining two
   different technologies is necessary; however, it is not simple. The
   research presented in the article is another attempt at connecting the
   world of BIM and GIS. The proposed integrated database environment of
   BIM/GIS spatial data makes it possible to store GIS and BIM data,
   enabling the use of the same data by both types of systems
   simultaneously and in a consistent manner. This allows BIM systems to to
   obtain simultaneous access to BIM and GIS data, which may be needed in,
   for example, the process of analyzing a building and its immediate
   surroundings. At the same time, GIS can obtain up-to-date building data
   necessary for spatial analyses, building management, or route mapping in
   navigation applications. The concept proposed in this article assumes a
   pragmatic approach, which is based on sharing Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) and CityGML schemas from a single database for BIM and GIS
   applications in their practically original form using an additional
   integrated BIM-GIS schema, called BIGI-S. The research joins some other
   works in this field, complementing them and adding a new perspective.
   This paper describes the concept of this solution, including specific
   data structures, data conversion algorithms, and a prototype solution.
   The tests carried out by the authors prove the robustness of the adopted
   concept and its technical feasibility.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management
   (AEC/FM) industry is undergoing a digital transformation, and digital
   assets are emerging to support the development and delivery of physical
   assets. While these digital assets can create value throughout a
   project's life cycle and the form of digital assets has been previously
   studied, there is a dearth of research focused on how team processes
   must change to optimize the implementation of these digital tools.
   Therefore, the research objective was to characterize processes,
   enablers, and barriers related to digital asset development in AEC/FM
   projects. This paper implemented a systematic literature review of 73
   journal articles published through December 31, 2023. This work
   identified 13 processes, 19 enablers, and 20 barriers to developing and
   delivering digital assets to support physical assets throughout their

Title = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) Capabilities in the Design and
   Planning of Rural Settlements in China: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With rural revitalization being established as the national policy in
   China, the environmental quality and residential comfort of rural
   settlements has received widespread attention from the whole society in
   China. However, due to the over-exploitation of resources and the uneven
   development between urban and rural in China, the environmental
   conditions and residential experience in rural settlements in China are
   still relatively backward. To prompt the environmental quality and
   residential comfort of rural settlements in China, it is necessary to
   optimize the planning and design of rural settlements in China. As a
   multi-function method, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can
   significantly contribute to the planning and design of rural settlements
   in China. To optimize the environmental quality and residential
   experience in rural settlements in China, this study is developed to
   perform a systematic literature review of the BIM capabilities in the
   design and planning phase of rural settlements in China. To achieve this
   aim, the PRISMA protocol was used to perform this systematic review. The
   review and discussion of this study were conducted between June 2022 and
   September 2022. In this study, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were
   adopted as the main databases, and 189 articles were reviewed. Through
   this systematic review, it can be identified that BIM capabilities have
   significant advantages in the following aspects of the design and
   planning of rural settlements in China: Data storage and management; 3D
   modeling and visualization; Disaster prevention and environmental
   analysis; Cost estimation and optimization. Furthermore, through the
   discussion and analysis of research results, it can be concluded that
   BIM capabilities can perform their benefits in the rural settlements'
   design and planning through their following characteristics: knowledge
   management, simulation, and modeling. Based on the research results, it
   can be identified that knowledge management capabilities in BIM can
   effectively provide information support and knowledge assistance
   throughout the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China.
   BIM's simulation and modeling capabilities can simulate and demonstrate

Abstract = {Effective asset management in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction/facilities management (AEC/FM) industry is crucial for
   improving asset performance and lifespan, as well as reducing downtimes
   and maintenance costs. Current asset management practices mostly rely on
   outdated paper-based approaches that are prone to data loss, security
   attacks, and missing information. Emerging technologies, such as digital
   twins, are being proposed to solve existing asset management problems in
   the AEC industry. However, the industry perspective is often missing in
   the evaluation of such technology-led approaches regarding actual
   applications and implementation challenges. This study seeks to
   understand the potential of digital twins in solving current asset
   management issues and challenges within the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
   context. To achieve this aim, structured interviews were conducted with
   14 industry experts to capture their understanding of current digital
   technologies and existing issues in asset management. The findings of
   this study underscore the transformative potential of digital twins as a
   tool for optimizing asset performance and decision-making throughout the
   asset lifecycle.},

Title = {A Digital Twin predictive maintenance framework of air handling units
   based on automatic fault detection and diagnostics},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {261},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The building industry consumes the most energy globally, making it a
   priority in energy efficiency initiatives. Heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning (HVAC) systems create the heart of buildings. Stable air
   handling unit (AHU) functioning is vital to ensuring high efficiency and
   extending the life of HVAC systems. This research proposes a Digital
   Twin predictive maintenance framework of AHU to overcome the limitations
   of facility maintenance management (FMM) systems now in use in
   buildings. Digital Twin technology, which is still at an initial stage
   in the facility management industry, use Building Information Modeling
   (BIM), Internet of things (IoT) and semantic technologies to create a
   better maintenance strategy for building facilities. Three modules are
   implemented to perform a predictive maintenance framework: operating
   fault detection in AHU based on the APAR (Air Handling Unit Performance
   Assessment Rules) method, condition prediction using machine learning
   techniques, and maintenance planning. Furthermore, the proposed
   framework was tested in a real-world case study with data between August
   2019 and October 2021 for an educational building in Norway to validate
   that the method was feasible. Inspection information and previous
   maintenance records are also obtained through the FM system. The results
   demonstrate that the continually updated data combined with APAR and
   machine learning algorithms can detect faults and predict the future
   state of Air Handling Unit (AHU) components, which may assist in
   maintenance scheduling. Removing the detected operating faults resulted
   in annual energy savings of several thousand dollars due to eliminating
   the identified operating faults. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {Development and application of a digital twin model for Net zero energy
   building operation and maintenance utilizing BIM-IoT integration},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {328},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) represent a significant opportunity to
   reduce building energy consumption and achieve the climate and energy
   goals that will be necessary in the future. Nevertheless, the effective
   operation and maintenance (O\&M) management of NZEB remains a
   significant challenge. This is largely due to the inadequate management
   of the O\&M phase and the lack of comprehensive data integration and
   application. Accordingly, this study proposes an O\&M digital twin
   modeling approach for integrating data in the O\&M phase of NZEB and
   realizing efficient management. The twin modeling process comprises data
   collection, model construction, simulation analysis, and validation
   iteration. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed twin model
   markedly enhances the utilization efficiency of O\&M data, facilitating
   the perception, visualization, and automated feedback control of NZEB.
   The proposed digital twin modeling method offers technical guidance for
   O\&M managers seeking to achieve efficient O\&M management of NZEB.},

Abstract = {Building maintenance includes actions that aim to ensure the components
   of a building are in acceptable conditions. In traditional maintenance
   methods, as-built drawings and maintenance manuals are regarded as
   essential documents for the operation and maintenance of buildings. In
   this method, the time and cost of facilities management are increased
   due to managing a large number of documents. Thus, the necessity of
   creating a range of fields from the information generation to the
   development of automation systems is evident in the maintenance services
   from the technological perspective. This research presents a
   computerized system that integrates the building information model
   objects in industry foundation classes and radio-frequency
   identification to improve building maintenance performance. The
   computerized system is successfully applied to the building of a soccer
   stadium via the proposed research methodology using a qualitative and
   practical approach. The main contribution of this research is to provide
   an innovative framework for the implementation of the proposed system
   with a step-by-step approach, and also to evaluate the maintenance
   methods to help different building maintenance stakeholders decide on
   the appropriate method. The research indicates that with a slight effort
   on the implementation of the proposed system, a significant improvement
   of overall maintenance performance can be achieved compared to the
   traditional method in terms of time, cost, and functionality. It is also
   hoped that the proposed system can join with other new technologies to
   promote the system's value in the field of building maintenance.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) plays a key role in digital design
   and construction and promises also great potential for facility
   management. In practice, however, for existing buildings there are often
   either no digital models or existing planning data is not up-to-date
   enough for use as as-is models in operation. While reality-capturing
   methods like laser scanning have become more affordable and fast in
   recent years, the digital reconstruction of existing buildings from 3D
   point cloud data is still characterized by much manual work, thus giving
   partially or fully automated reconstruction methods a key role. This
   article presents a combination of methods that subdivide point clouds
   into separate building storeys and rooms, while additionally generating
   a BIM representation of the building's wall geometries for use in CAFM
   applications. The implemented storeys-wise segmentation relies on planar
   cuts, with candidate planes estimated from a voxelized point cloud
   representation before refining them using the underlying point data.
   Similarly, the presented room segmentation uses morphological operators
   on the voxelized point cloud to extract room boundaries. Unlike the
   aforementioned spatial segmentation methods, the presented parametric
   reconstruction step estimates volumetric walls. Reconstructed objects
   and spatial relations are modelled BIM-ready as IFC in one final step.
   The presented methods use voxel grids to provide relatively high speed
   and refine their results by using the original point cloud data for
   increased accuracy. Robustness has proven to be rather high, with
   occlusions, noise and point density variations being well-tolerated,
   meaning that each method can be applied to data acquired with a variety
   of capturing methods. All approaches work on unordered point clouds,
   with no additional data being required. In combination, these methods
   comprise a complete workflow with each singular component suitable for
   use in numerous scenarios.},

Title = {Developing a conceptual framework for the application of digital twin
   technologies to revamp building operation and maintenance processes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Globally, the Architecture Engineering Construction (AEC) industry has
   seen a rise in the adoption of digital twin (DT) technologies due to
   their potential to enhance collaboration and information communication
   throughout the project lifecycle from the design to operation and
   maintenance (O \& M) phase. However, empirical evidence on such adoption
   is fragmented, particularly for facility management (FM) activities
   during the O \& M phase. Considering this gap, an illustrative case
   study approach is performed to analyze and compare the traditional
   practices of FM with DT-driven FM during the O \& M phase using four
   geospatially representative cases. The findings show that DT
   technologies enable efficient and responsive planning and control of FM
   activities by providing real-time status of the building assets.
   However, barriers such as the misalignment of the data integration and
   data standards hamper their future implementation. To address this, a
   bottom-up conceptual framework is proposed to facilitate a wider
   implementation of DT technologies and support FM during the O \& M phase
   of buildings. As such, this paper's contribution is twofold: (1) it
   provides an aggregate landscape of DT application to manage facilities
   during the O \& M phase, and (2) it develops an evidence-induced
   conceptual framework for stakeholders who are grappling with their FM
   decision-making processes.},

Abstract = {This study introduces a Bayesian network model to evaluate the comfort
   levels of occupants of two nonresidential Norwegian buildings based on
   data collected from satisfaction surveys and building performance
   parameters. A Digital Twin approach is proposed to integrate building
   information modeling (BIM) with real-time sensor data, occupant
   feedback, and a probabilistic model of occupant comfort to detect and
   predict HVAC issues that may impact comfort. The study also uses 200000
   points as historical data of various sensors to understand the previous
   building systems' behavior. The study also presents new methods for
   using BIM as a visualization platform and for predictive maintenance to
   identify and address problems in the HVAC system. For predictive
   maintenance, nine machine learning algorithms were evaluated using
   metrics such as ROC, accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall, where
   Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) was the best algorithm for prediction.
   XGB is on average 2.5\% more accurate than Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
   and up to 5\% more accurate than the other models. Random Forest is
   around 96\% faster than XGBoost while being relatively easier to
   implement. The paper introduces a novel method that utilizes several
   standards to determine the remaining useful life of HVAC, leading to a
   potential increase in its lifetime by at least 10\% and resulting in
   significant cost savings. The result shows that the most important
   factors that affect occupant comfort are poor air quality, lack of
   natural light, and uncomfortable temperature. To address the challenge
   of applying these methods to a wide range of buildings, the study
   proposes a framework using ontology graphs to integrate data from
   different systems, including FM, CMMS, BMS, and BIM. This study's
   results provide insight into the factors that influence occupant
   comfort, help to expedite identifying equipment malfunctions and point
   towards potential solutions, leading to more sustainable and
   energy-efficient buildings. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {In the construction industry, technology plays a significant role.
   Techniques such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR),
   holograms, and other visualization techniques have been primarily
   concerned with sectors such as sales, marketing, and real estate. This
   paper aims to develop a handheld mobile application that assists
   facility engineers in visualizing all underground utilities enriched
   with all inspection data using building information modeling (BIM)
   technologies. It outlines a process for developing a smartphone AR
   application that visualizes infrastructure networks to improve
   infrastructure operation and maintenance (O\&M) workflows. Localizing
   precision is a significant issue for two reasons. The first is that
   virtual 3D graphics models are not stable via most AR applications. The
   second is that they make the user believe that the virtual model floats
   or does not represent reality. The BIM 360 Docs application is used to
   store and manage all project data such as drawings, reports, and 3D
   models, whereas BIM 360 Build is used in completing and sending
   inspection forms. Vuforia and ARCore software development kits (SDKs)
   are being comparatively researched. This study aims to measure the
   scaling and flickering of the ARField mobile application, virtual model
   consistency, and the mobile devices it supports. A survey was conducted
   between managers/engineers of installations and visualization experts.
   This survey emphasizes the usability, technicality, and probability of
   the application distribution. The findings show that 80\% of
   visualization experts realized that the application developed by ARCore
   SDK is more robust than the application developed by Vuforia. It is
   worth noting that the proposed research is considered an integrated AR
   construction technology that facilitates asset management professionals'
   tasks by providing an easy-to-use reliable solution.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Large underground spaces are complex and huge, with problems such as
   fragmented data that cannot be shared, outdated management methods, and
   high operation and maintenance costs. The digitization of building
   information and the use of digital twin technology can effectively
   improve the efficiency of building operation and maintenance. Using
   information technology to build a digital-twin-based operation and
   maintenance management system, the huge and discrete data and equipment
   system information are effectively integrated and explored for
   application. First, we analyze the shortcomings of the traditional
   delivery and operation and maintenance methods and introduce the
   necessity of a new method of operation and maintenance management based
   on digital twin; then, we divide the operation and maintenance
   information of the construction project into four major categories of
   spatial information and eight major categories of equipment information
   and complete the coding work, and the categorized data serve as the data
   basis for operation and maintenance; second, we develop a digital twin
   operation and maintenance management platform based on the operation and
   maintenance data of BIM; finally, we carry out case validation for the
   three major constructions. Finally, case validation is carried out for
   three major buildings and a large underground space and the practical
   application shows that the operation and maintenance management system
   based on digital twin technology provides technical guarantee for
   decentralized information and system integration management and the
   information management quality and efficiency of the operation and
   maintenance process are effectively improved. Through the practice of
   summarizing the experience, which is worth learning, we aim to create a
   large underground space operation and maintenance management method to
   provide a reference.},

   Operations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 16},
Abstract = {Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTs) are defined as capable of achieving some
   elements of cognition, notably memory (encoding and retrieval),
   perception (creating useful data representations), and reasoning
   (outlier and event detection). This paper presents the development of a
   CDT, populated by construction information, facility management data,
   and data streamed from the Building Automation System (BAS). Advanced
   machine learning was enabled by access to both real-time and historical
   data coupled with scalable cloud-based computational resources.
   Streaming data to the cloud has been implemented in existing
   architectures; to address security concerns from exposing building
   equipment to undesirable access, a secure streaming architecture from
   BACnet equipment to our research cloud is presented. Real-time data is
   uploaded to a high-performance scalable time-series database, while the
   ontology is stored on a relational database. Both data sources are
   integrated with Building Information Models (BIM) to aggregate, explore,
   and visualize information on demand. This paper presents a case study of
   a Digital Twin (DT) of an academic building where various capabilities
   of CDTs are demonstrated through a series of proof-of-concept examples.
   Drawing from our experience enhancing this implementation with elements
   of cognition, we present a development framework and reference
   architecture to guide future whole-building CDT research.},

Abstract = {This work presents a Self Sovereign Identity based system proposal to
   show how Blockchain, Building Information Modeling, Internet of Thing
   devices, and Self Sovereign Identity concepts can support the process of
   building digitalization, guaranteeing the compliance standards and
   technical regulations. The proposal ensures eligibility, transparency
   and traceability of all information produced by stakeholders, or
   generated by IoT devices appropriately placed, during the entire life
   cycle of a building artifact. By exploiting the concepts of the Self
   Sovereign Identity, our proposal allows the identification of all
   involved stakeholders, the storage off-chain of all information, and
   that on-chain of the sole data necessary for the information
   notarization and certification, adopting multi-signature approval
   mechanisms where appropriate. In addition it allows the eligibility
   verification of the certificated information, providing also useful
   information for facility management. It is proposed as an innovative
   system and companies that adopt the Open Innovation paradigm might want
   to pursue it. The model proposal is designed exploiting the Veramo
   platform, hence the Ethereum Blockchain, and all the recommendations
   about Self Sovereign Identity systems given by the European Blockchain
   Partnership, and by the World Wide Web Consortium.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to explore the body of knowledge on
   BIM-enabled facility management (BIM-FM). This study proposes a method
   for knowledge mapping analysis through scientometric analysis, which
   uses two software, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace, to analyze the results of
   literature data related to BIM-FM. 319 journal articles were collected
   for collaborative network analysis, co-occurrence network analysis, and
   co-citation network analysis. The findings of the study conclude that 1)
   the knowledge structure of BIM-FM was divided into five significant
   clusters; 2) the key research topics of BIM-FM show an evolutionary
   trend in different periods, from model construction, framework, and
   gradually expanding to implementation, system integration, and smart
   building; 3) future research foresees three research directions,
   including enhancing the application of BIM in multiple facility
   management; advanced applications in facility management; health and
   safety for facility managers; and improving regulations and risk

Abstract = {The importance of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in construction
   and facility operation is unquestionable, but there is a clear
   discrepancy between the data included in as-built BIM models and the
   expected use specified by customers. This disparity presents significant
   obstacles in properly using BIM for facility management and operational
   operations. The main goal of this research is to suggest inventive and
   pragmatic approaches that successfully address the discrepancy between
   the actual BIM model data, with a specific emphasis on COBie dataset,
   and the intended BIM applications outlined by stakeholders in the
   Employer's Information Requirement (EIR) for facility management and
   operation. The study methodology is based on a comprehensive examination
   of current literature, demo case studies, as well as standards
   pertaining to BIM data, COBie.Type, and EIR requirements. The results of
   this study consist of a collection of standards, procedures, and
   suggested practices specifically designed to improve the utilization of
   as-built BIM model data for facility management and operation. These
   will closely correlate with the BIM applications stated by the client.
   Furthermore, the project seeks to enhance industry norms and practices,
   promoting enhanced cooperation and information sharing among
   stakeholders. This research has also investigated the efficiency of
   Solibri Model Checker (SMC) to validate the COBie type and component
   information provided by COBie.},

Title = {AR-based automatic pipeline planning coordination for on-site
   mechanical, electrical and plumbing system conflict resolution},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {141},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) system conflicts are
   complicated problems given the involved multidisciplinary nature and
   constraint-bearing coordination. Although Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) shows benefit to resolving the conflicts before construction, the
   on-site pipeline inspection and further adjustment are inevitably
   necessary due to practical issues caused by deviations with plans. Given
   this, the research aims at developing an on-site pipeline inspection and
   automatic coordination approach by using Augmented Reality (AR) and a
   grid-based path-planning algorithm. The approach allows the site
   practitioners to compare the newly added pipe layout plan with the
   existing pipelines and re-plan the pipe layout where encountered
   conflicts, further obtaining a solution without clashes. The method
   considers MEP system constraints in practice and searches conflict-free
   pipe layout plans in near real-time. Furthermore, the path coordination
   process also considers MEP design criteria, including its function,
   construction, and maintenance. The planned pipe layout is displayed
   through AR to link the information from the virtual model to the real
   world. The performance tests are conducted in virtual scenarios with
   different grid cell sizes and priorities of pipes to evaluate the
   planning results. The test results show that under room and aisle space
   scenarios, the implemented approach can obtain path solutions with
   approximately 10 s, and most of them comply with the pre-defined MEP
   design requirements. Through this study, automatic pipe planning with
   constraints is proved to be feasible to provide an effective onsite
   conflict resolution approach to improve the MEP construction process and
   future maintenance.},

Title = {Automatic Detection of Geometric Errors in Space Boundaries of IFC-BIM
   Models Using Monte Carlo Ray Tracing Approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {In Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) building information modeling
   (BIM), the objectified concept of a space boundary (SB) provides a means
   to define building space geometries with surface entities. Such
   building-geometry definitions are widely used for various engineering
   applications such as energy simulation, lighting analysis, and facility
   management. However, quality issues (i.e., geometric and nongeometric
   issues) of SBs have been widely reported, which makes it necessary to
   validate the SBs before retrieving them from IFC models for relevant
   applications. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of reliable
   mechanisms/tools to automatically evaluate the quality of SBs,
   especially the geometric quality. This study proposes a Monte Carlo ray
   tracing approach to automatically detect geometric errors in SBs. The
   approach checks SBs space by space in terms of whether each space is
   correctly bounded by its SBs. The geometric errors in the set of SBs of
   a space that the approach can detect include gaps, overhangs, and
   overlaps between SBs as well as incorrect surface normal directions of
   SBs. To accelerate the ray tracing process in the approach, the
   axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) tree is implemented to spatially index
   SBs of each space. The approach is evaluated with extensive performance
   tests in terms of robustness and efficiency. The results show that the
   approach can robustly and efficiently detect all four types of geometric
   errors even in extreme cases and that the AABB tree helps speed up the
   approach significantly for large-scale IFC models with many complex
   spaces.},

Title = {Integrating BIM into sensor-based facilities management operations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {385-400},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Purpose
   To mitigate the problems in sensor-based facility management (FM) such
   as lack of detailed visual information about a built facility and the
   maintenance of large scale sensor deployments, an integrated data source
   for the facility's life cycle should be used. Building information
   modeling (BIM) provides a useful visual model and database that can be
   used as a repository for all data captured or made during the facility's
   life cycle. It can be used for modeling the sensing-based system for
   data collection, serving as a source of all information for smart
   objects such as the sensors used for that purpose. Although few studies
   have been conducted in integrating BIM with sensor-based monitoring
   system, providing an integrated platform using BIM for improving the
   communication between FMs and Internet of Things (IoT) companies in
   cases encountered failed sensors has received the least attention in the
   technical literature. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to
   conceptualize and develop a BIM-based system architecture for fault
   detection and alert generation for malfunctioning FM sensors in smart
   IoT environments during the operational phase of a building to ensure
   minimal disruption to monitoring services.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper describes an attempt to examine the applicability of BIM for
   an efficient sensor failure management system in smart IoT environments
   during the operational phase of a building. For this purpose, a
   seven-story office building with four typical types of FM-related
   sensors with all associated parameters was modeled in a commercial BIM
   platform. An integrated workflow was developed in Dynamo, a visual
   programming tool, to integrate the associated sensors
   maintenance-related information to a cloud-based tool to provide a fast
   and efficient communication platform between the building facility
   manager and IoT companies for intelligent sensor management.
   Findings
   The information within BIM allows better and more effective
   decision-making for building facility managers. Integrating building and
   sensors information within BIM to a cloud-based system can facilitate
   better communication between the building facility manager and IoT
   company for an effective IoT system maintenance. Using a developed
   integrated workflow (including three specifically designed modules) in
   Dynamo, a visual programming tool, the system was able to automatically
   extract and send all essential information such as the type of failed
   sensors as well as their model and location to IoT companies in the
   event of sensor failure using a cloud database that is effective for the
   timely maintenance and replacement of sensors. The system developed in
   this study was implemented, and its capabilities were illustrated
   through a case study. The use of the developed system can help facility
   managers in taking timely actions in the event of any sensor failure
   and/or malfunction to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services.
   Research limitations/implications
   However, there are some limitations in this work which are as follows:
   while the present study demonstrates the feasibility of using BIM in the
   maintenance planning of monitoring systems in the building, the
   developed workflow can be expanded by integrating some type of sensors
   like an occupancy sensor to the developed workflow to automatically
   record and identify the number of occupants (visitors) to prioritize the
   maintenance work; and the developed workflow can be integrated with the
   sensors' data and some machine learning techniques to automatically
   identify the sensors' malfunction and update the BIM model accordingly.
   Practical implications
   Transferring the related information such as the room location,
   occupancy status, number of occupants, type and model of the sensor,
   sensor ID and required action from the BIM model to the cloud would be
   extremely helpful to the IoT companies to actually visualize workspaces
   in advance, and to plan for timely and effective decision-making without
   any physical inspection, and to support maintenance planning decisions,
   such as prioritizing maintenance works by considering different factors
   such as the importance of spaces and number of occupancies. The
   developed framework is also beneficial for preventive maintenance works.
   The system can be set up according to the maintenance and time-based
   expiration schedules, automatically sharing alerts with FMs and IoT
   maintenance contractors in advance about the IoT parts replacement. For
   effective predictive maintenance planning, machine learning techniques
   can be integrated into the developed workflow to efficiently predict the
   future condition of individual IoT components such as data loggers and
   sensors, etc. as well as MEP components.
   Originality/value
   Lack of detailed visual information about a built facility can be a
   reason behind the inefficient management of a facility. Detecting and
   repairing failed sensors at the earliest possible time is critical to
   ensure the functional continuity of the monitoring systems. On the other
   hand, the maintenance of large-scale sensor deployments becomes a
   significant challenge. Despite its importance, few studies have been
   conducted in integrating BIM with a sensor-based monitoring system,
   providing an integrated platform using BIM for improving the
   communication between facility managers and IoT companies in cases
   encountered failed sensors. In this paper, a cloud-based BIM platform
   was developed for the maintenance and timely replacement of sensors
   which are critical to ensure minimal disruption to monitoring services
   in sensor-based FM.},

Title = {Evaluation platform for sustainable operation of stadiums integrating
   multidimensional data: Based on a multifunctional perspective},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {287},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {The sustainable construction and operation of large stadiums has been
   widely recognized as an important goal. Existing building sustainability
   evaluation criteria mainly focused on the energy-saving dimension.
   However, more dimensions (such as economy, intelligence level,
   conversion difficulty, etc.) that are quite important for
   multifunctional buildings' sustainable operation have earned only
   limited attention. This research aimed to develop a sustainability
   evaluation system that integrates multidimensional parame-ters by taking
   Chinese stadiums as a precursor to influence the assessment criteria for
   the sustainable operation of local multifunctional buildings. Based on
   an extensive review of sustainable building assess-ment methods in the
   published literature and expert interviews, this research constructed a
   stadium sus-tainability performance database as an initial pool of
   criteria to comprehensively reflect the environmental, social, and
   economic attributes of stadiums. The indicators and data gathered were
   eval-uated through regression analysis and principal component analysis
   (PCA) to clarify the impact and weight of indicators in the evaluation
   system. In addition, the study developed an online visual evalua-tion
   platform based on the evaluation system combined with Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) to assist architects to complete the
   performance evaluation of the stadium and the prediction of future
   design. 3 cases of different types of stadiums in China were evaluated
   to demonstrate the platform inter-face. The findings of current research
   will help architects, administrators, and researchers accomplish
   sustainability in the design, management, and operation of stadiums.(c)

Title = {An overview of data tools for representing and managing building
   information and performance data},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted for
   representing and exchanging building data across disciplines during
   building design and construction. However, BIM's use in the building
   operation phase is limited. With the increasing deployment of low-cost
   sensors and meters, as well as affordable digital storage and computing
   technologies, growing volumes of data have been collected from
   buildings, their energy services systems, and occupants. Such data are
   crucial to help decision makers understand what, how, and when energy is
   consumed in buildings-a critical step to improving building performance
   for energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience. However,
   practical analyses and use of the collected data are very limited due to
   various reasons, including poor data quality, ad-hoc representation of
   data, and lack of data science skills. To unlock value from building
   data, there is a strong need for a toolchain to curate and represent
   building information and performance data in common standardized
   terminologies and schemas, to enable interoperability between tools and
   applications. This study selected and reviewed 24 data tools based on
   common use cases of data across the building life cycle, from design to
   construction, commissioning, operation, and retrofits. The selected data
   tools are grouped into three categories: (1) data dictionary or
   terminology, (2) data ontology and schemas, and (3) data platforms. The
   data are grouped into ten typologies covering most types of data
   collected in buildings. This study resulted in five main findings: (1)
   most data representation tools can represent their intended data
   typologies well, such as Green Button for smart meter data and Brick
   schema for metadata of sensors in buildings and HVAC systems, but none
   of the tools cover all ten types of data; (2) there is a need for data
   schemas to represent the basis of design data and metadata of occupant
   data; (3) standard terminologies such as those defined in BEDES are only
   adopted in a few data tools; (4) integrating data across various stages
   in the building life cycle remains a challenge; and (5) most data tools
   were developed and maintained by different parties for different
   purposes, their flexibility and interoperability can be improved to
   support broader use cases. Finally, recommendations for future research
   on building data tools are provided for the data and buildings community
   based on the FAIR principles to make data Findable, Accessible,
   Interoperable, and Reusable.},

Abstract = {Since there is a growing interest in driving the digital transformation
   of the construction industry, the goal of this paper is to provide a
   full picture and understanding of the emerging research front on
   intelligent construction. Through the quantitative and qualitative
   analysis, relevant pieces of literature are thoroughly reviewed to
   extract useful knowledge to raise awareness of intelligent construction,
   resulting in the summary of research status and the determination of
   future needs. In light of the research findings, the rapid development
   of intelligent construction follows the strategies of standardization,
   digitization, intellectualization, collaboration, greenization, and
   customization, which mainly support ``4S{''} technologies. The popular
   research topics covering intelligent engineering services for the
   project's full lifecycle (i.e., design, construction, operation, and
   maintenance) and even the city level have been deeply explored, which
   are proven to dramatically improve project efficiency, safety, and
   automation. Moreover, challenges exist in three potential paths for
   future research, including the digital twin-enabled engineering cloud
   platform, man-machine-environment interaction, great sustainability
   under carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. As for the practical
   value, a synthesized point of up-to-date reference is created to guide

Abstract = {Development of low thermal conductivity and high strength building
   materials is an emerging strategy to solve the heavy energy consumption
   of buildings. This study develops sustainable alkali activated materials
   (AAMs) for structural members from waste expanded polystyrene (EPS)
   beads and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to simultaneously meet the
   thermal insulation and mechanical requirements of building energy
   conservation. It was found that the thermal conductivity of AAMs with 80
   vol.\% EPS and 0.04 wt.\% rGO (E8-G4) decreased by 74\% compared to the
   AAMs without EPS and rGO (E0). The 28-day compressive and flexural
   strengths of E8-G4 increased by 29.8\% and 26.5\% with the addition of
   80 vol.\% EPS and 0.04 wt.\% rGO, compared to the sample with 80 vol.\%
   EPS without rGO (E8). In terms of compressive strength, thermal
   conductivity, and cost, the efficiency index of E8-G4 was higher than
   those of other materials. A building model made from AAMs was designed
   using building information modeling (BIM) tools to simulate energy
   consumption, and 31.78\% of total energy consumption (including heating
   and cooling) was saved in the building operation period in Harbin City,
   China. Hence, AAMs made of waste EPS beads and rGO can realize the
   structural and functional integrated application in the future.},

Abstract = {The integration of the building information modelling (BIM) and assets
   database has enabled a potential pathway for building stakeholders to
   add value to the building lifecycle management (BLM) processes. However,
   the obtaining, storing, processing, and distributing of data have not
   been ratified in a detailed and semantic manner in any official
   guideline. This paper suggests a framework for the efficient development
   of an interoperable visualisation of a building ``digital twin{''}
   through an intuitive interface, to contribute to the idea above. The
   framework was applied in two case studies as examples, where rich
   visualisations of two buildings in the Kanta-flame region of Finland
   were constructed using their architectural models and building indoor
   climate metrics. By constructing an engaging interface, relevant metrics
   and constant feedback from buildings' occupants are gathered, meaningful
   data is selected, processed, and displayed to improve the facility
   management (FM) process. The yielded result is a progressive web
   application (PWA), where valuable sets of building performance data are
   visualised and a promptly communicable channel between owners/occupants
   and building system is delivered. Further development of this
   application in practice and research work is also proposed to harness
   the data-driven monitoring and automation in buildings to the greatest
   extent.},

Title = {Developing a BIM GIS-Integrated Method for Urban Underground Piping
   Management in China: A Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Underground piping remains one of the key uncertain infrastructures in
   urban development. Because they are buried underground without a clear
   vision, the management of the underground piping system is more
   complicated than other infrastructure. Their records are not usually
   fully available or accurate, and excavation to validate underground
   structures is often needed in infrastructure projects. Detection of
   unexpected obstacles may lead to project delay, increased time spent,
   and risk of damaging existing piping. The traditional underground piping
   system management relies on computer-aided design (CAD) drawings and
   historical empiricism. Still, it cannot meet the strict requirements of
   infrastructure management nowadays or make the management efficient and
   sustainable because of the technical limitations and conceptual
   obsolescence. Therefore, to address this issue, this paper proposes an
   innovative method that aims to manage the underground piping life cycle.
   This method is to develop a building information model (BIM) in a
   geographic information system (GIS) environment by integrating
   heterogeneous data from both BIM and GIS, which not only achieves
   three-dimensional (3D) visualization but also seamlessly connects to
   portfolios, programs, projects, and assets throughout the life cycle of
   urban underground piping. This is a critical development to integrate
   and analyze geometric and nongeometric information of aboveground and
   subsurface building assets and the surrounding environment to stimulate
   interaction with real-world context. This paper also introduces a case
   study in China to further prove the feasibility of this method and the
   format based on it in practice. In the case study, the proposed method
   is implemented together with a piping sensor to further illustrate the
   effectiveness of the method over trenchless detection and real-time
   monitoring for daily management of underground piping. Because the model
   is visible and the monitoring is in real time, the management would be
   straightforward. At the same time, this method can analyze, plan, and
   monitor activity, so the management of urban underground piping systems
   would become smart. Therefore, an efficient and sustainable management
   performance can be achieved. This method is meaningful for managing the
   urban underground piping system, especially for those with expansion,
   refurbishment, or maintenance for an urban underground piping system.},

Title = {Barriers to building information modelling and facility management
   practices integration in Nigeria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {845-865},
Month = {NOV 22},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to explore and review the critical perspectives
   of stakeholders in the facility management (FM) industry as regards the
   barriers to building information modelling (BIM) integration, with the
   view to providing significant insights to mitigate the barriers to BIM
   implementation. Design/methodology/approach An extensive literature
   review was conducted to identify critical barriers to BIM-FM
   integration. Ten categories of barriers were identified from the
   literature review and used to design a Likert scale-based questionnaire,
   which was administered to registered members of International Facility
   Management Association based in Lagos, Nigeria. The data collected were
   analysed using both descriptive (mean score, standard deviation,
   frequency tables and charts) and inferential statistics (Shapiro-Wilk
   and Kruskal-Wallis tests). Findings The descriptive and inferential
   analysis demonstrated a disparity in the ranking of the ten barriers
   among the groups. Six (out of ten) barriers to BIM implementation for FM
   practices are identified as critical (mean score greater than 4.0):
   insufficient awareness levels of BIM-FM integration benefits,
   non-existence of contractual and legal framework for BIM implementation,
   limited studies on BIM-FM inter-relationship, poor acceptance levels and
   resistance to change among stakeholders, perception of BIM and
   inadequacy of mode data. And the results of the one-sample t-tests show
   that there were statistically significant differences in the six.
   Practical implications This study offers significant insights to
   industry stakeholders in understanding BIM implementation barriers in
   FM, as well as the framework for mitigating them. These findings could
   also be applied to other developing countries, with special
   consideration given to locational differences. Originality/value The
   valuable information provided in this study could be used as a roadmap
   to improve BIM-FM practice implementation in Nigeria. It also measured
   differences in the opinions of professionals.},

Title = {A Review of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for Facility Management

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been extensively studied and
   applied within the AEC sector, particularly in design and construction.
   In recent years, Facility Management (FM) processes are becoming more
   digitalised, thus requiring effective BIM-FM integration. BIM adoption
   in many countries, such as the UK, Italy and Brazil, has been publicly
   driven. Generally, adoption was targeted at design and construction
   implementation, with little effort in framing public action for FM
   implementation. The lack of an integrated approach for BIM-FM
   implementation resulted in numerous bespoken implementation approaches
   that mimic the private sector and hinder knowledge exchange. Therefore,
   there is a need for assessing and amalgamating knowledge about BIM-FM
   for public organisations. This research aims to leverage knowledge about
   BIM-FM in the public domain by analysing and classifying articles
   published between 2010-2021. The research was carried out through a
   systematic review and comparative thematic analysis investigating the
   use of BIM for different public buildings (e.g., schools and hospitals)
   and the implementation for FM purposes. Research results outline
   prevalent trends and areas of research from three perspectives: people,
   process and technology. Results show an increasing number of
   publications about BIM-FM. However, the divide between BIM-FM for public
   and private organisations is unequal. BIM-FM research for public
   organisations is still limited and lacks standardisation. This
   state-of-the-art review makes an incremental contribution to knowledge
   by identifying progress, gaps and new industry directions on the subject
   matter.},

Title = {Facility Energy Management Application of HBIM for Historical Low-Carbon
   Communities: Design, Modelling and Operation Control of Geothermal
   Energy Retrofit in a Real Italian Case Study},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The highest challenge of energy efficiency of building stock is
   achieving improved performance in existing buildings and, especially, in
   heritage buildings which per se are characterized by massive limitations
   against the implementation of the most sophisticated solutions for
   energy saving. In Italy, historical buildings represent more than 30\%
   of the building stock and the vast majority require energy retrofit,
   while ensuring the preservation of the heritage value and acceptable
   comfort conditions. In this context, historical buildings must be
   retrofitted and re-functioned by introducing innovative technologies
   aimed at reducing energy consumption and improving human comfort,
   health, and safety. To this aim, this study implements the Historic
   Building Information Modeling (HBIM) approach for the integrated
   modeling, monitoring, management, and maintenance of a novel geothermal
   system involving horizontal ground source heat exchangers (GHEXs)
   coupled to an adsorption heat pump for the energy refurbishment of
   historical buildings. In detail, a rural building part of a medieval
   complex in Perugia, Central Italy, is considered as a pilot case study.
   The analysis stresses the potential of the Facility Management (FM)

Title = {Barriers to the implementation of Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   for facility management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Reportedly, the application of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a
   collaborative methodology for the life-cycle management of a building
   has numerous benefits. Nevertheless, its adoption during the operational
   stage remains limited, and the New Zealand (NZ) built environment is no
   exception. The present study offers a prioritized list of barriers that
   are inhibiting industry-wide adoption of BIM during the facility
   management (FM) phase. Both BIM and FM contexts were first thoroughly
   reviewed to identify the potential barriers (26), which were then
   refined via semi-structured interviews with qualified experts
   representing industry and academia. The refined barriers (20) were then
   prioritized through a hybrid Parsimonious Fuzzy AHP approach. Despite
   the leadership of the decision-makers in promoting the use of BIM in all
   phases of the building life cycle, the cost-related barriers (both for
   BIM software/hardware and training) remain the most significant.
   Perhaps, as a result of this, lack of expertise and unfamiliarity with
   BIM associated technology is among the most inhibiting barriers, which
   also requires utmost attention. It can be concluded that the industry
   stakeholders need to commit additional resources to help overcome the
   barriers and enable a wider application of BIM for FM. Increased
   application of BIM for FM will have positive implications for the future
   of the FM industry and digital future of the built environment, which
   has been a national strategy. The results are believed to identify the
   most crucial barriers impeding technology supported change in FM
   practices.},

Journal = {INTELLIGENT BUILDINGS INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-16},
Abstract = {Occupancy monitoring in smart buildings has great potential to improve
   their operational performance. One of the most common applications
   concerns the dynamic adaptation of indoor conditions according to the
   occupancy variation. However, other implementations are possible.
   Occupancy data could also enhance maintenance smart contracts
   management, especially if coupled with a contracts' management system as
   blockchain through which it is possible to achieve higher reliability
   and trust in transactions. In this article, a methodology to monitor
   occupancy data with a low-cost network, composed by a set of ultrasonic
   sensors, is presented. To ensure the collection of consistent data,
   different tests were performed for defining a convenient configuration
   for their installation. Following the proposed methodology, gathered
   data are processed and stored into a digital asset model associated with
   the building maintenance plan. Once a predefined threshold is reached,
   the system triggers a maintenance alert to the contractor to activate
   cleaning operations. The proposed approach enables an enhancement of the
   automation of maintenance management operations in a cost-effective
   manner. However, further validation trials are required to test the
   flexibility of its application in different space types.},

Abstract = {The integration of operational information in building life-cycle
   management is a relevant topic within the facilities management domain.
   A previous study proposed a methodology based on Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) and Facility Management (FM) systems integration,
   underpinned by a Performance Information Model, to support the
   performance assessment and the maintenance management. The purpose of
   this paper is to extend and validate that methodology with an open
   standard approach. A subset of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)
   schema related to performance assessment and maintenance procedures is
   mapped into a relational database. The database supports the integration
   between BIM models and facilities information systems. Case studies
   including healthcare buildings test the database and a new application.
   The results contribute to the BIM adoption in the FM domain. Also, the
   studied and validated IFC schema subset can be considered as a
   contribution to the Model View Definition for FM.},

Abstract = {While initial costs in building economics cover a small portion of the
   costs incurred during its life cycle, most occur in construction,
   operation, and subsequent processes. Despite its numerous contributions
   to building economics, the construction industry is slowly adapting to
   digital technologies. To overcome the barriers and crown the assets with
   their proper management, dynamic applications of digital tools and
   techniques of Industry 4.0 need to emerge in the construction industry.
   Therefore, this study aims to present an integrative approach that
   combines quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques to critically
   review the available literature on the potential contributions of
   digital construction technologies to building economics through the
   post-design phases of the life cycle. The primary focus of the
   investigation is how digital technologies can overcome prevalent
   problems and how they can impact building economics. The study
   contributes to the field by providing an awareness that will inform
   researchers and practitioners of the trends, gaps, and more profound
   exchange of ideas in future research efforts.},

Title = {Building information modelling (BIM)-enabled facility management (FM) of
   nursing homes in China: A systematic review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {99},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {China's aging population is increasing because of longer life expectancy
   and declining fertility rates. This demographic shift has increased the
   demand for eldercare facilities in China, making high-quality and
   efficient facility management (FM) a top priority for nursing home
   facility managers. Building information modelling (BIM) has been
   proposed as an effective means of improving work efficiency during
   nursing home operations and maintenance. This study explored the current
   strategies and approaches for integrating BIM and FM into nursing homes
   to support the systematisation and intellectualisation of workflows
   during operations and maintenance. To achieve this goal, the Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) scheme
   was used for systematic evaluation. This systematic review searched
   scientific databases of related disciplines (e.g. Scopus, Web of
   Science, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure {[}CNKI]) from
   January 2010 to March 2023, supplemented by manual retrieval methods.
   Among the 694 articles, 63 were analysed from four perspectives: 1) FM
   problems faced by nursing homes, 2) the benefit of using BIM in FM, 3)
   the potential of BIM applications to support nursing home FM, and 4)
   future research directions. This study addresses the research gap in the
   connection between BIM and FM in nursing homes through a comprehensive
   literature review and examines the challenges and benefits of BIM in
   nursing home operations. Additionally, this research contributes to the
   advancement of BIM applications in nursing home operations and
   maintenance, offering practical insights for industry decisionmakers to
   meet the escalating demands of an aging society.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The implementation of BIM in FM has been of steadily growing interest
   for academic research. Yet the benefits of BIM for the FM in CREM have,
   to the present day, been explored to a limited extent. As research on
   BIM for FM in CREM remains narrowly investigated, this study follows an
   exploratory approach to formulate implications for further research
   directions. Therefore, a four-stage procedure was adopted: (1)
   identification and definition of BIM uses for FM in CREM; (2) validation
   of the BIM uses for FM in CREM and the expert survey questionnaire; (3)
   assessment of each BIM use's benefit by experts; and (4) analysis of the
   correlations between BIM uses' benefit assessments and the respondents'
   industries, the resulting associations, and the prioritisation for the
   development of BIM uses for FM in CREM. Based on that methodology, it
   was shown that the BIM use for FM in CREM with the highest priority for
   development is 46 Facilities and Equipment: Repair and Renewal. The BIM
   use with the lowest priority is 21 Visualisation. As a result, four
   implications on the development of BIM uses for FM in CREM were
   formulated regarding case studies, information requirements, and
   technical requirements, as well as process and personnel requirements.},

Title = {Digital Twin of HVAC system (HVACDT) for multiobjective optimization of

Abstract = {This study proposes a novel Digital Twin framework of heating,
   ventilation, and air conditioning (HVACDT) system to reduce energy
   consumption while increasing thermal comfort. The framework is developed
   to help the facility managers better understand the building operation
   to enhance the HVAC system function. The Digital Twin framework is based
   on Building Information Modelling (BIM) combined with a newly created
   plug-in to receive real-time sensor data as well as thermal comfort and
   optimization process through Matlab programming. In order to determine
   if the suggested framework is practical, data were collected from a
   Norwegian office building between August 2019 and October 2021 and used
   to test the framework. An artificial neural network (ANN) in a Simulink
   model and a multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) are then used to
   improve the HVAC system. The HVAC system is comprised of air
   distributors, cooling units, heating units, pressure regulators, valves,
   air gates, and fans, among other components. In this context, several
   characteristics, such as temperatures, pressure, airflow, cooling and
   heating operation control, and other factors are considered as decision
   variables. In order to determine objective functions, the predicted
   percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) and the HVAC energy usage are both
   calculated. As a result, ANN's decision variables and objective function
   correlated well. Furthermore, MOGA presents different design factors
   that can be used to obtain the best possible solution in terms of
   thermal comfort and energy usage.The results show that the average
   cooling energy savings for four days in summer is roughly 13.2\%, and
   10.8\% for the three summer months (June, July, and August), keeping the
   PPD under 10\%. Finally, compared to traditional approaches, the HVACDT
   framework displays a higher level of automation in terms of data
   management.},

Title = {BIM-based method to inform operation and maintenance phases through a
   simplified procedure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {65},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The use of BIM in the architecture, engineering, construction and
   operation (AECO) industry is becoming increasingly widespread.
   Nevertheless, interoperability with Computerized Mainte-nance Management
   Systems (CMMS) remains a significant challenge in the domain.
   Furthermore, available applications require high expertise to correctly
   implement the data export, don't allow incremental database updates and
   are overall non-cost-effective, moreover in the case of small and
   medium-sized structures. At the same time, given the need to invest in a
   more sustainable built environment, it is necessary to consider the
   whole lifecycle of constructions, including the operation and
   maintenance phase, while designing. In the framework of this scenario,
   the paper presents a research work which defines a method to implement
   interoperability between BIM and CMMS software by using the IFC open
   standard, to allow an easier management of buildings, from design to
   decommissioning. This method, devised to be as feasible as possible,
   combines an operational procedure and a practical tool. The work was
   supported by the software house Prometeo Srl and the Facility Management
   company GEMMO SpA. The method was developed based on the Feltre Hospital
   (Italy) and results, that were technically validated through an ad hoc
   BIM model, can be used by other practitioners to further implement the
   method in other research.},

Title = {Rule-based automation algorithm for generating 2D deliverables from BIM},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {97},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Efficient generation of two-dimensional (2D) deliverables from building
   information models (BIM) entails remarkable challenges, impacting
   project productivity. To address this issue, BIMDrawGEN, a rule-based
   algorithm, was developed in this study to streamline the creation of
   essential 2D deliverables during the design development phase. This
   approach involves an analysis of the BIM design process, resulting in
   the derivation of 76 automation rule sets for generating logically
   defined 2D deliverables from BIM data. A prototype add-in interfacing
   with BIM authoring tools was developed to validate the model,
   demonstrating significant reductions in work nodes and time by 94.54 \%
   and 93.26 \%, respectively, for BIM-based drawing creation. Significant
   reduction in working hours, from nearly a week to under half a day,
   using BIMDrawGEN enhances both industrial and academic outcomes. This
   efficiency enables designers to focus more on design rather than
   documentation. This study identifies and addresses inefficient processes
   in BIM, demonstrating that targeted automation could significantly
   improve design quality and productivity.},

Title = {EVALUATING THE USE OF VIRTUAL REALITY FOR MAINTAINABILITY-FOCUSED DESIGN
   REVIEWS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {253-272},
Abstract = {The Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) phase can account for as much as
   80\% of the overall lifecycle cost of a project. The inputs from O\&M
   practitioners are often not incorporated during the design phase leading
   to maintainability issues during the O\&M phase, which results in
   significant costs and hinders building performance. Traditionally,
   design communication with practitioners is conducted using 2D drawings
   and in some more advanced projects, with Building Information Models
   (BIMs). Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to facilitate
   maintainability-focused design input from O\&M practitioners, but this
   application has not been studied in detail. This paper addresses the gap
   by examining the usability of VR for providing access-related
   maintainability inputs. A quasi-experimental approach was adopted to
   evaluate the difference in access-related inputs provided by sixteen
   O\&M practitioners, once using 2D drawings and BIM and again using VR.
   We assessed the variation in time for O\&M practitioners to provide the
   inputs and the perceived quality of the inputs using the two design
   communication methods. We also examined the effect of practitioners'
   years of experience on providing access-related maintainability inputs
   using VR. The results suggest that there was no statistically
   significant difference in the access-related maintainability inputs
   provided using the two design communication methods, which demonstrates
   that O\&M practitioners could provide similar access-related inputs
   using VR and traditional means of communication using 2D drawings and 3D
   models. The results also show that O\&M practitioners were able to
   provide inputs significantly faster using VR. The O\&M practitioners
   also reported that VR facilitated ease of use and high confidence in
   their inputs. Furthermore, the practitioners' years of experience did
   not lead to any variation in the access-related inputs provided and the
   time efficiency of providing the inputs. While the small sample size
   limits the generalizability of the results, the study acts as a proof of
   concept on the usability of VR for improving O\&M practitioner input on
   the maintainability of building designs.},

Abstract = {Purpose Current research efforts exhibit a surge imperative for a
   building information modelling (BIM) approach that embodies a repository
   of all relevant data of existing building components while monitoring
   and consistently recording numerous components' functions throughout its
   lifecycle, especially in Egypt. This research paper aims to develop an
   integrated as-is BIM-facility management (FM) information model for the
   existing building's components via a case study, depicting a repository
   for historical data and knowledge amassed from inspections and conveying
   maintenance decisions automatically during the FM practices.
   Design/methodology/approach The developed approach pursues four
   successive steps: data acquisition and processing of building
   components; components recognition from point clouds; modelling scanned
   point clouds; and quick response code information transfer to BIM
   components. Findings The proposed approach incorporates the as-is BIM
   with the building components' as-is FM information to portray a
   repository for historical data and knowledge collected from inspections
   to proactively benefit facility managers in simplifying, expediting and
   enhancing maintenance decisions automatically during FM practices.
   Originality/value This paper presents a digital alternative to manual
   maintenance recordkeeping concerning building components to retrieve
   their as-is and historical data using a case study in Egypt. This paper
   proposes a broad scan to as-is information BIM approach for the existing
   building's components to condone maintenance interventions using a
   versatile, affordable, readily available and multi-functional method for
   scanning the building's components using a handheld tool.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {In recent years, Facility Management has undergone significant
   technological and methodological advancements, primarily driven by
   Building Information Modelling (BIM), Computer-Aided Facility Management
   (CAFM), and Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS). These
   innovations have improved process efficiency and risk management.
   However, challenges remain in asset management, maintenance,
   traceability, and transparency. This study investigates the potential of
   blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to address these
   challenges. By referencing international (ISO, BOMA) and European (EN)
   standards, the research develops an asset management process model
   incorporating blockchain and NFTs. The methodology includes evaluating
   the technical and practical aspects of this model and strategies for
   metadata utilization. The model ensures an immutable record of
   transactions and maintenance activities, reducing errors and fraud.
   Smart contracts automate sub-phases like progress validation and
   milestone-based payments, increasing operational efficiency. The study's
   practical implications are significant, offering advanced solutions for
   transparent, efficient, and secure Facility Management. It lays the
   groundwork for future research, emphasizing practical implementations
   and real-world case studies. Additionally, integrating blockchain with
   emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Intelligence in Industry 4.0 has led to the development of smart
   buildings with various control systems for data collection, efficient
   optimization, and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). However,
   buildings, especially with regard to heating, ventilation, and air
   conditioning (HVAC) systems, are responsible for significant global
   energy consumption. Digital Twin (DT) technology offers a sustainable
   solution for facility management. This study comprehensively reviews DT
   performance evaluation in building life cycle and predictive
   maintenance. 200 relevant papers were selected using a systematic
   methodology from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, and various
   FDD methods were reviewed to identify their advantages and limitations.
   In conclusion, data-driven methods are gaining popularity due to their
   ability to handle large amounts of data and improve accuracy,
   flexibility, and adaptability. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning
   as data-driven methods are important for FDD in building operations,
   such as with HVAC systems, as they can handle unlabeled data and
   identify complex patterns and anomalies. Future studies should focus on
   developing interpretable models to understand how the models made their
   predictions. Hybrid methods that combine different approaches show
   promise as reliable methods for further research. Additionally, deep
   learning methods can analyze large and complex datasets, indicating a
   promising area for further investigation.},

Abstract = {Digitisation of the built environment is seen as a significant factor
   for innovation in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and
   Operation sector. However, lack of data and information in as-built
   digital models considerably limits the potential of Building Information
   Modelling in Facility Management. Therefore, optimisation of data
   collection and management is needed, all the more so now that Industry
   4.0 has widened the use of sensors into buildings and infrastructures. A
   literature review on the two main pillars of digitalisation in
   construction, Building Information Modelling and Internet of Things, is
   presented, along with a bibliographic analysis of two citations and
   abstracts databases focusing on the operations stage. The bibliographic
   research has been carried out using Web of Science and Scopus databases.
   The article is aimed at providing a detailed analysis of BIM-IoT
   integration for Facility Management (FM) process improvements. Issues,
   opportunities and areas where further research efforts are required are
   outlined. Finally, four key areas of further research development in FM
   management have been proposed, focusing on optimising data collection
   and management.},

Abstract = {In the digital era, the application of new technologies, specifically
   information technology, has led to the development of building
   information modelling (BIM), a new technology that helps the
   construction management industries address current challenges. The level
   of development (LOD) and precision of BIM data throughout a project play
   a pivotal role in guaranteeing the triumph of building endeavours and
   asset management. The determination of the amount of depth and quality
   of BIM information plays a crucial role in influencing all aspects of a
   project and the lifespan of building assets. Therefore, this study aims
   to ascertain the frequency of components used for asset management
   drawing from a pilot project in Vietnam and to suggest the need for LOD
   components in facility management (FM). Expert polls, input from
   building operations managers and a literature review of LOD decision
   plans and BIM standards led to the conclusion that BIM was the most
   suitable approach for this objective. Two questionnaire surveys and an
   expert interview with key personnel from owners, contractors and
   consultants were conducted. The survey results table, which shows the
   substructure, superstructure and interior component categories, shows
   that the study results advise on how often to use different types of
   construction information. A framework is suggested that outlines the LOD
   and implementation model for the building of the database and the
   development of future studies. In the long term, the conceptual model
   promotes the transfer of knowledge from one project to another.},

Abstract = {Purpose Despite the continuous development of Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) standards, not all of its dimensions are supported to the
   same extent. This is the case of Building Automation Systems (BAS) in
   which the features that are limited mostly to physical setup of devices
   are supported. These are largely insufficient to support modeling
   automation scenarios. The purpose of this article is to clarify the gap
   in the state of the art and define the need for further developments.
   Design/methodology/approach This article explores the existing gap in
   the literature and discusses the hypothesis of extending BIM to a wider
   support of BA concepts. Based on an assessment of scientific and
   technical literature, this study elicits the information requirements of
   BA and performs a gap analysis with current BIM standards, such as
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). Findings Our findings lead us to
   conclude that there is a lack of completeness regarding features from
   BAS automation and management levels. Furthermore, it is shown that IFC
   is the most adequate data model to cover BAS without losing its purpose,
   but there is still a considerable work that needs to be addressed in
   future research. Originality/value BIM standards such as IFC position
   themselves as natural candidates for modeling and exchanging information
   regarding BA. However, the extent to which BIM supports automation
   features has never been rigorously analyzed. This article explores the
   existing gap in the literature and discusses the hypothesis of extending
   BIM to a wider support of BA concepts. Based on an assessment of
   scientific and technical literature, this study elicits the information
   requirements of BA and performs a gap analysis with current BIM

Title = {BIM-based decision support for building condition assessment},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {135},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building condition assessment requires the integration of various types
   of data such as building characteristics, the properties of
   elements/systems and maintenance records. Previous research has focused
   on identifying these data and developing a building condition risk
   assessment model based on Bayesian networks (BN). However, due to
   interoperability issues, the process of transferring the data is
   performed manually, which requires considerable time and effort. To
   address this issue, this paper presents a data model to integrate the
   building condition risk assessment model into BIM. The proposed data
   model is implemented in existing software as a case study and tested and
   evaluated on three scenarios. Addressing interoperability will leverage
   the BIM tool as a data repository to automate the data transfer process
   and improve its consistency and reliability. It will also enable BIM to
   be a more effective tool for building condition and causality analysis

Title = {Towards fully BIM-enabled building automation and robotics: A
   perspective of lifecycle information flow},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {135},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has seen
   a continuous growth in the application of Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) over the last two decades while building automation and robotics
   is also gaining ground in the meantime. With more joint applications of
   both BIM and robotics being exposed, the compatibility of BIM for
   robotic building construction and maintenance has been found to be
   fundamentally key to further practical implementations. This paper
   presents an integrated review combining quantitative and qualitative
   analyses to clarify the development roadmap of BIM-enabled building
   automation and robotics. Firstly, information and data management in
   Digital Twin and robotic building tasks is recapped as the prior
   knowledge. Secondly, a systematic review on BIM-related research topics
   in the last 18 years is conducted to demonstrate the inevitability and
   feasibility of BIM-robot integration, informed by the evolution of
   lifecycle building information flow. Then, critical analysis on three
   typical examples of BIM-based robotic construction (i.e. printing,
   assembling, and welding) are successively performed to reflect the
   potential BIM-robot integration mechanism and challenges ahead. Finally,
   a new unified robot-oriented BIM framework, namely BIMfAR, is proposed
   to conclude the cogitation based on the above analyses. Under the BIMfAR
   framework, definitions of basic concepts and a practical workflow are
   discussed to provide guidelines for future applications. (C) 2021

   was established highlighting a lack of guidance specifically aimed to
   help clients formulate information requirements as the appointing party.
   This research makes recommendations for an approach to define the
   requirements and support successful outcomes for BIM projects. Practical
   implicationsThis paper provides a standardised approach and a starting
   point for an appointing party to gather and structure information
   requirements in line with ISO 19650. Originality/valueThis paper

Abstract = {The scope of facility management spans from traditional activities like
   repair \& maintenance, health \& safety, through to real estate
   management, financial management, change management, and even contract
   management, tender and procurement, construction, and demolition and
   disposal of the constructed facility. It therefore requires considering
   sustainability aspects of construction, which are better addressed
   through sustainable design strategies. A consolidated but holistic
   framework has been conceptualized to ensure sustainability in facility
   management, especially to practice in building and AEC (architecture,
   engineering and construction) sectors. Although testing and validation
   is needed, the conceptualized framework is expected to achieve
   sustainability in the relevant sectors.},

   Occluded Point Clouds},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {As-built building information modeling (BIM) currently is regarded as a
   tool with the potential to manage buildings efficiently in the operation
   and maintenance phases. However, as-built BIM modeling is a
   labor-intensive process that requires considerable cost and time in
   modeling existing buildings. Although active research on scan-to-BIM
   automation has addressed this issue, previous studies modeled only major
   objects such as walls, floors, and ceilings, consequently requiring
   modeling other objects in indoor spaces. In addition, there was a
   limitation in modeling objects located in the occluded areas of scanned
   point clouds. Therefore, this study extracted various indoor objects
   from a point cloud based on deep-learning, and compensated for
   incomplete object information from occluded point clouds for automating
   the process of scan-to-BIM. The number of object classes extracted from
   the semantic segmentation of a deep learning network was increased to
   13, and spatial relationships between objects were defined to improve
   the accuracy of bounding boxes extracted from point clouds. Furthermore,
   a parametric algorithm was developed to match the bounding boxes and
   objects in a BIM library to generate BIM models automatically. In a case
   study involving an office room, the accuracy of the bounding boxes of
   some object classes improved by as much as 53.33\%. The study verified
   the feasibility of the proposed method of scan-to-BIM automation for the
   three-dimensional (3D) reality capture of existing buildings.},

Abstract = {There has been a significant increase in studies related to Industry 4.0
   alongside the development of new technologies, devices and software,
   becoming one of the most relevant topics for years within the so-called
   Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). The Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction sector (AEC) sector is one step behind other engineering
   fields in productivity, and digitalisation can help reduce this gap.
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) implementation in various project
   phases with other technologies such as the Internet of Things, Big Data,
   Blockchain or Geographic Information System (GIS) are the main drivers
   of Smart Construction. This paper provides an updated state-of-art of
   the BIM applications through different civil engineering projects and
   towards the use of new Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICTs). Hence, the integration of BIM in the Facility Management through
   ICTs allows decision making based on data analysis and the optimization
   of available resources.},

Title = {Scan-to-graph: Semantic enrichment of existing building geometry},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has changed the way in which
   buildings are conceived, planned and executed. Apart from their frequent
   use for as-planned buildings, BIM authoring tools have now been adopted
   for a number of years for digitising existing buildings as well, mostly
   by performing a `scan-to-BIM' process: the creation of a BIM model,
   primarily based on point clouds. However, some inherent characteristics
   of existing buildings are complicating such a process: uncertainties,
   geometric irregularities, classification of heritage building
   components, linking sources about the real-world asset and an
   interdisciplinarity that may go beyond traditional Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction (AEC) topics (e.g. heritage, Facility
   Management, sensor data and damage assessment). In this paper, a
   framework called `scan-to-graph' (STG) is proposed to integrate the
   concepts of scan-to-BIM with Semantic Web technologies, as these could
   provide answers to the above -mentioned challenges, most notably on
   documentation of uncertainties, sources and modelling decisions, element
   classification and cross-discipline information linking. In order to
   test the STG concept, a use case was developed where the Audience Room
   of the Gravensteen castle in Ghent was reconstructed from point clouds,
   semantically enriched and stored as an RDF graph. The resulting graph
   contains multiple interlinked geometry types, metadata about the
   reconstruction process and the sources and allows to unambiguously refer
   to other contextual data on the Web.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the architecture, engineering, construction, and
   facility management (FM) industries have been applying various emerging
   digital technologies to facilitate the design, construction, and
   management of infrastructure facilities. Digital twin (DT) has emerged
   as a solution for enabling real-time data acquisition, transfer,
   analysis, and utilization for improved decision-making toward smart FM.
   Substantial research on DT for FM has been undertaken in the past
   decade. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the literature on
   DT for FM. A total of 248 research articles are obtained from the Scopus
   and Web of Science databases. VOSviewer is then utilized to conduct
   bibliometric analysis and visualize keyword cooccurrence, citation, and
   co-authorship networks; furthermore, the research topics, authors,
   sources, and countries contributing to the use of DT for FM are
   identified. The findings show that the current research of DT in FM
   focuses on building information modeling-based FM, artificial
   intelligence (AI)-based predictive maintenance, real-time cyber-physical
   system data integration, and facility lifecycle asset management.
   Several areas, such as AI-based real-time asset prognostics and health
   management, virtual-based intelligent infrastructure monitoring, deep
   learning-aided continuous improvement of the FM systems, semantically
   rich data interoperability throughout the facility lifecycle, and
   autonomous control feedback, need to be further studied. This review
   contributes to the body of knowledge on digital transformation and smart
   FM by identifying the landscape, state-of-the-art research trends, and
   future needs with regard to DT in FM.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to review the status quo, current state of
   research, research hot themes and research gaps in sustainable
   facilities management (SFM) in the built environment (BE) through an
   extant literature review.
   Design/methodology/approach - To map and analyze knowledge paths in the
   context of SFM research, a sequential explanatory mixed-method review
   involving bibliometric and content analysis was used to help identify
   current research trends, research hot themes and knowledge gaps. The
   Scopus search engine was used to find 169 relevant articles. For a
   better understanding of the literature accumulated, a bibliometric
   analysis was carried out by using VOSviewer to reveal current research
   themes, the status quo and current state of research as well as research
   gaps.
   Findings - Through the literature review and content analysis, the
   current research themes on SFM revealed from the study include green
   building technologies, assessment methods of SFM, smart buildings and
   building information modeling. The research hot themes in SFM include
   smart buildings and green building technologies, green buildings (GB),
   architectural and building designs in the university sector, assessment
   methods in buildings and decision-making and the adoption of asset and
   facility management in the university sector. Indoor air pollution,
   intelligent buildings, climate change, maintenance, environmental
   management, facilities, historic preservation, environmental
   performance, energy management, etc. are the research gaps identified
   from the study, and these serve as potential areas for future research
   studies under SFM. It was recognized that facilities managers are
   increasingly involved with sustainability policies within their
   organizations and are developing sustainability agendas to keep up with
   the changing nature of the facilities management (FM) profession.
   Practical implications - The findings of this study hold relevance to
   the FM practice, as the integration of SFM by facilities managers can
   lead to waste reduction, decreased operating expenses and reduced energy
   consumption. In addition, occupants of sustainable buildings experience
   improved conditions that contribute to better health and productivity,
   thus boosting their overall well-being. Consistent with the themes of
   smart buildings and green technologies, revealed to be the hot themes in
   the SFM research scope, properties with sustainable features can command
   higher rental rates and property values, appealing to a broader range of
   stakeholders. SFM practices in universities can aid in saving money from
   reduced facility operational costs and improve the image of institutions
   while creating better indoor environments for students and staff. The
   analyses of countries involved in research can open doors for the
   establishment of research groups and the development of collaboration
   between universities in different countries researching similar topics
   of interest.
   Originality/value - The geographical scope of this study is not limited
   and, therefore, encourages broad applicability of the findings to the
   global sustainable BE.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) technology can organically combine
   data modeling and virtual reality, and compare them with actual
   construction objects to realize the smart collaboration of entity and
   the model in the construction processes, greatly reducing early stage
   mistakes and improve construction efficiency. This paper proposed an
   automation system framework of smart construction based on BIM
   technology and collaboration platform, and discussed the element
   configuration of smart construction based on BIM technology and
   collaboration platform, and finally elaborated the working mechanism of
   automated system based on BIM technology and collaboration platform. The
   study results show that the automation system based on the BIM
   technology and collaboration platform supports the rapid construction of
   large-scale three-dimensional scenes and the precise integration of
   multi-source data, and can bring together construction information and
   asset information from different sources to form an open, safe, and
   accessible digital environment. The application of smart construction
   technology in construction cost management has brought huge economic
   benefits, construction efficiency has been increased by 65\%,
   construction period has been shortened by 30\%, labor intensity has been
   reduced by 27\%, and labor productivity has been increased by 39\%,
   which has brought considerable indirect benefits to construction
   projects.},

Title = {Use of BIM-FM to Transform Large Conventional Public Buildings into
   Efficient and Smart Sustainable Buildings},
Journal = {ENERGIES},

Abstract = {New technologies regarding construction, materials and facility
   management have led to the successful implementation of smart and more
   sustainable buildings. This is of special interest for the management of
   large and complex public buildings. However, most of these types of
   buildings were built in Europe during the previous century, when those
   technologies were still a matter of research. The appearance of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) and the combined use of it with other
   advances in Facility Management (FM) as well as Internet of Things
   (IoT), Big Data and others, has opened the door to the possible
   transformation of such type of buildings into more efficient smart
   buildings without very large investments. In this study, this was
   studied thoroughly. In addition, the advantages and possibilities were
   assessed on a case study performed in the Civil Engineering School at
   Universidad Politecnica de Madrid built in 1969. The main objective of
   the paper was to show the details and possibilities to transform the
   building into a smart and more sustainable building by using BIM-FM
   techniques and self-designed sensors. The conclusions showed that using
   a three-dimensional model as the center of the management together with
   the connection with other applications, databases and facility
   management tools can transform the building into a Smart Building. In
   addition, the management of the system can be done from the web, nearing
   the information to the management staff and to the user. All advances
   were self-developed in order to satisfy the specific needs of the
   building.},

Abstract = {Conventional scan to building information modeling (BIM) automation
   mainly deals with geometry. However, one of its limitations is the time
   it takes and the costs in generating material. Therefore, this study
   proposes an automated scan-to-BIM method considering both the geometry
   and material of building objects. It recognizes the geometry from a
   point cloud and the material from panorama images through deep
   learning-based semantic segmentation. The two extracted pieces of data
   are merged, and the BIM objects with material are automatically
   generated by using Dynamo. Here, the object-space relationships were
   applied to increase the accuracy of the material data to be included in
   the BIM object. As the result, the accuracy was improved by 48.66\%
   compared with before the application. The proposed method can contribute
   to the improvement of the as-built BIM model usability because it can
   automatically generate a BIM model by reflecting the material, as well
   as the geometry of the existing building.},

Title = {A Method to Compute Shadow Geometry in Open Building Information
   Modeling Authoring Tools: Automation of Solar Regulation Checking},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building solar protection regulations is essential to save energy in hot
   climates. The protection performance is assessed using a shading factor
   computation that models the sky irradiance and the geometry of shadow
   obstructing the surface of interest. While Building Information Modeling
   is nowadays a standard approach for practitioners, computing shadow
   geometry in BIM authoring tools is natively impossible. Methods to
   compute shadow geometry exist but are out of reach for the usual BIM
   authoring tool user because of algorithm complexity and non-friendly BIM
   implementation platform. This study presents a novel approach, dubbed
   solid clipping, to calculate shadow geometry accurately in a BIM
   authoring tool. The aim is to enhance project delivery by enabling solar
   control verification. This method is based on typical Computer Aided
   Design (CAD) in BIM authoring tools. The method is generic enough to be
   implemented using any BIM authoring tool's visual and textual API. This
   work demonstrates that a thermal regulation, here the French overseas
   one, can be checked concerning solar protection, thanks to a BIM model.
   Beyond automation, this paper shows that, by directly leveraging the BIM
   model, designs presently not feasible by the usual process can be
   studied and checked.},

Abstract = {As a building ages, various types of problem caused by issues such as
   water leakage become more likely. Building information models (BIMs) are
   becoming more commonly used in the design and construction phases.
   Effort has been expended to also make them more effective in the
   maintenance phase. This study develops an add-on tool for predicting the
   scope of water leakage using the results of geometric operations between
   different elements in a BIM. A case study of water leakage associated
   with deteriorating rooftop waterproofing is presented. The development
   of the tool is based on interviews and a literature survey. The process
   of water spreading from a starting spot is described using multiple
   stages. A drawing on a plan view and calculation results based on the
   number of elements are presented to the user. The developed add-on tool
   is evaluated using a case study on some rooms in a BIM. The proposed
   tool can represent the knowledge and experience related to facility
   management using BIM technology. The novelty of the proposed tool is
   that it focuses on the detailed geometry and exact placement of elements
   in a BIM used for maintenance purposes and uses these elements in edited
   form.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},

Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Purpose The integration and automation of the whole design and
   implementation process have become a pivotal factor in construction
   projects. Problems of process integration, particularly at the
   conceptual design stage, often manifest through a number of significant
   areas, from design representation, cognition and translation to process
   fragmentation and loss of design integrity. Whilst building information
   modelling (BIM) applications can be used to support design automation,
   particularly through the modelling, amendment and management stages,
   they do not explicitly provide whole design integration. This is a
   significant challenge. However, advances in generative design now offer
   significant potential for enhancing the design experience to mitigate
   this challenge. Design/methodology/approach The approach outlined in
   this paper specifically addresses BIM deficiencies at the conceptual
   design stage, where the core drivers and indicators of BIM and
   generative design are identified and mapped into a generative BIM
   (G-BIM) framework and subsequently embedded into a G-BIM prototype. This
   actively engages generative design methods into a single dynamic BIM
   environment to support the early conceptual design process. The
   developed prototype followed the CIFE ``horseshoe{''} methodology of
   aligning theoretical research with scientific methods to procure
   architecture, construction and engineering (AEC)-based solutions. This
   G-BIM prototype was also tested and validated through a focus group
   workshop engaging five AEC domain experts. Findings The G-BIM prototype
   presents a valuable set of rubrics to support the conceptual design
   stage using generative design. It benefits from the advanced features of
   BIM tools in relation to illustration and collaboration (coupled with
   BIM's parametric change management features). Research
   limitations/implications This prototype has been evaluated through
   multiple projects and scenarios. However, additional test data is needed
   to further improve system veracity using conventional and non-standard
   real-life design settings (and contexts). This will be reported in later
   works. Originality/value Originality and value rest with addressing the
   shortcomings of previous research on automation during the design
   process. It also addresses novel computational issues relating to the
   implementation of generative design systems, where, for example, instead
   of engaging static and formal description of the domain concepts, G-BIM
   actively enhances the applicability of BIM during the early design
   stages to generate optimised (and more purposeful) design solutions.},

Title = {Automation of escape route analysis for BIM-based building code checking},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The use of BIM is becoming increasingly important in the AEC industry
   because the included dataset enables the automation of many processes.
   One emerging application of BIM is the automation of building code
   checking by building authorities. Building code checking is a
   time-consuming process, particularly for escape routes. Therefore, its
   automation promises considerable optimisation potential. This study
   presents a semi-automated escape route analysis for building code
   checking. Our developed concept consists of two automated steps, with a
   legally required manual step in between: (1) escape route generation,
   which provides possible routes from which designers can select a valid
   combination, and (2) escape route validation, which checks the selected
   combination of escape routes for validity. The basis of both automated
   steps is a novel indoor navigation model. We implemented the concept in
   Solibri Office and validated it with real-world models. The developed
   escape route analysis method shows potential to improve designers'
   escape route planning and building authorities' escape route checking.},

Abstract = {Precast construction is a productivity-improving technology in the
   architectural, engineering, and construction industry that improves
   construction efficiency by combining factory-based manufacturing and
   lean assembly. Many international efforts have encouraged the adoption
   of this approach. This study presents an integrated Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) with technological automation interoperability to enable
   generative design and prefabrication for precast buildings. A generic
   BIM-based graph representation is established to explicitly formulate
   buildings' spatial and geometric features. Following this, a
   graph-constrained layout generator is developed, with a generative
   modelling algorithm and graph convolutional neural network, to extract
   pairwise spatial-geometric features for generating the optimal precast
   layout. This is followed by semantic enrichment of BIM data (i.e.,
   Industry Foundation Classes) with precast data schema to facilitate data
   transformation for prefabrication automation until site delivery. The
   holistic approach presented in this study empowers pre-construction
   planning optimisation and fabrication automation in precast
   construction.},

Abstract = {Facility Management (FM) regards the management of buildings' assets and
   requires the administration of a large amount of data that must always
   be available, but today, they still consist of paper documents, which
   are susceptible to loss. This is one of the principal causes for costs
   increase in the Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) phase, together with
   the lack of interoperability and communication. In recent years, the
   construction industry has been undergoing a process of digitalization,
   supported from the advent of new technologies that hit the market at low
   prices. This study aims to indagate the technologies introduced in in
   the FM sector, in addition the major authors and sources that are
   studying them. A bibliometric analysis is conducted on 220 documents
   belonging to the Scopus DB. The documents were analyzed using
   bibliometric analysis tools, such as Biblioshiny and VOSviewer. The
   results show how FM and the implementation of technologies in its
   practices, such as Building information modelling (BIM), Internet of
   Things (IoT) and Digital Twin (DT), are fields with exponential growth
   in recent years. Other technologies, such as blockchain, artificial
   intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and augmented reality (AR),
   emerged as part of digitalization in FM, which is part of the transition
   towards Construction 4.0.},

Abstract = {The aging population is growing drastically all over the world. With the
   advent of the global era, universal design is garnering considerable
   interest, as the number of multicultural families is increasing, and
   various user classes are being created. In addition, with the advances
   in construction technology, architectural design is becoming more
   diverse, and convenience facilities are also getting distributed in
   various ways. As a result, more buildings need to apply universal
   design, indicating that various architectural information and universal
   design for the user class are required. Various data are needed for
   universal design evaluation, but there is a limit to evaluating with
   two-dimensional (2D) drawings. However, the limitations of 2D drawings
   can be overcome via building information modeling (BIM) combined with
   architectural data, which remarkably simplifies the universal design
   evaluation. This study was conducted with the aim to analyze
   architectural information by extracting architectural elements necessary
   for universal design evaluation from BIM data. It was confirmed that the
   calculations for universal design evaluation can be performed by 3D
   shape or attribute analysis using BIM data and computer programming. In
   order to create an automated evaluation algorithm for universal design,
   the evaluation methods were classified according to the universal design
   evaluation guide, based on building users and user diversity. In
   addition, even if the evaluation methods were the same by location,
   different points were classified by location, and evaluation items and
   information necessary for the evaluation were organized by category for
   each facility. Through this classification, we created an algorithm with
   seven types of methods for extracting the BIM data and comparing them by
   evaluation method for an automated analysis. In addition, an analysis
   was performed directly on the BIM design sample model using an automated
   evaluation algorithm. Although there were various architectural objects
   in the design data, evaluation was possible using algorithms. By
   applying the universal design evaluation and BIM data evaluation
   methods, we could confirm that the BIM-based universal design automation
   evaluation method prevents human error and is thus superior to the
   existing evaluation methods. Further, the automation evaluation method
   can contribute to BIM activation as the BIM data can be used in various
   studies such as design certification evaluation and automation analysis.},

Title = {A systematic taxonomic review of the application of BIM and digital
   twins technologies in the construction industry},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 23},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study provides a comprehensive analysis of the transition
   from Building Information Modelling (BIM) to digital twins (DT) in the
   construction industry. Specifically, the research explores the current
   state (themes and trends) and future directions of this emerging
   research domain.Design/methodology/approachA multi-stage approach was
   employed that combines scientometric and systematic review approaches.
   The scientometric analysis involves quantitative assessment of
   scientific publications retrieved from the Web of Science database -
   using software tools like VOSviewer and HistCite. The systematic review
   involved a rigorous synthesis and evaluation of the existing literature
   to identify research gaps, themes, clusters and future directions.
   Clusters obtained from the scientometric analysis of the co-occurrence
   network were then used as a subject base for a systematic
   study.FindingsEmergent findings reveal a rapidly growing interest in
   BIM-DT integration, with over 90\% of publications since 2020. The
   United Kingdom, China and Italy are the leading contributing countries.
   Five prominent research clusters identified are: (1) Construction 4.0
   technologies; (2) smart cities and urban environments; (3) heritage BIM
   and laser scanning; (4) asset and facility management; and (5) energy
   and sustainability. The study highlights the potential of BIM-DT
   integration for enhancing project delivery, asset management and
   sustainability practices in the built environment. Moreover, the
   project's life cycle operation phase has garnered the most attention
   from researchers in this field compared to other
   phases.Originality/valueThis unique study is comprehensive in its
   approach by combining scientometric and systematic methods to provide a
   quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the BIM-DT research
   landscape. Unlike previous reviews that focused solely on facility
   management, this study's scope covers the entire construction sector. By
   identifying research gaps, challenges and future directions, this study
   establishes a solid foundation for researchers exploring this emerging
   field and envisions the future landscape of BIM-DT integration in the
   built environment.},

   Development for Port Facility},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the AECO field, there have been many efforts to transform the design,
   construction, and maintenance methods that have been carried out in the
   traditional way based on document-based data into digital ones. BIM
   makes it possible for the information necessary for the entire
   construction process to be transformed into a language that computers
   can understand. In the field of architecture, BIM has been actively used
   throughout the entire construction life cycle through steady research
   since the 2000s, while COBie was developed in order to deliver
   information generated in the design and construction phase to the
   maintenance phase based on the BIM environment. In the field of
   infrastructure, however, digital data-based maintenance information
   management has not been actively studied. In particular, in the case of
   a port, once a facility is built, it has to be maintained for a longer
   period than other facilities, so facility maintenance is of utmost
   importance. Therefore, this study applied COBie, which is being used in
   the architecture field (building), to the port field. To this end, the
   COBie standard format in the port field was developed based on the port
   facility object breakdown structure and property breakdown structure.
   The port COBie developed through this study is included when the BIM
   model is converted to the IFC model so that facility management can be
   performed through the IFC-based viewer in the future. The port COBie
   schema developed in this study can be expanded to other fields such as
   roads and bridges in the future.},

Title = {Integrating BIM-IoT and Autonomous Mobile Robots for Construction Site
   Layout Printing},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The traditional methods of marking construction site layouts using
   manual techniques such as chalk lines are prone to human errors,
   resulting in discrepancies between blueprints and actual layouts. This
   has serious implications for project delivery, construction, costs and,
   eventually, project success. However, this issue can be resolved through
   autonomous robots and construction automation in line with Industry 4.0
   and 5.0 goals. Construction automation enables workers to concentrate on
   the construction phase and not worry about manual site markups. This
   leads to an enhancement in their productivity. This study aims to
   improve the floor layout printing technique by introducing a framework
   that integrates building information modeling (BIM) and the Internet of
   Things (IoT), i.e., BIM-IoT and autonomous mobile robots (AMR). The
   development process focuses on three key components: a marking tool, an
   IoT-based AMR and BIM. The BIM-based tools extract and store coordinates
   on the cloud platform. The AMR, developed using ESP32 and connected to
   the Google Firestore cloud platform, leverages IoT technology to
   retrieve the data and draw site layout lines accordingly. Further, this
   research presents a prototype of an automated robot capable of
   accurately printing construction site layouts. A design science research
   (DSR) method is employed in this study that includes a comprehensive
   review of the existing literature and usage of AMRs in construction
   layout printing. Subsequently building upon the extant literature, an
   AMR is developed and experiments are conducted to evaluate the system's
   performance. The experiment reveals that the system's precision falls
   within a range of +/- 15 mm and its angle accuracy is within +/- 4
   degrees. Integrating robotic automation, IoT and BIM technologies
   enhances the efficiency and precision of construction layout printing.
   The findings provide insights into the potential benefits of deploying
   AMRs in construction projects, reducing site layout errors and improving
   construction productivity. This study also adds to the body of knowledge
   around construction automation in line with Industry 4.0 and 5.0
   endeavors.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) has revolutionized production and
   operations management in the construction industry. Currently, however,
   the BIM environment can integrate only basic static information. Expert
   knowledge information to guide the building activity process is lacking.
   Consequently, with the increasing complexity of building services, BIM
   has difficulty adapting to the needs of rapid collaboration in the
   building operation process. To solve this problem, first, we present the
   basic knowle-dge-embedded model. The model provides services for
   knowledge generation and knowledge embedding. Moreover, taking BIM-based
   fire emergency management as an example, the formal modelling and
   credibility verification of knowledge are adopted to standardize the
   knowledge generated from experts to reduce future input errors and
   interpretation. Second, to provide the capability of process knowledge
   representation in BIM, we embedded the knowledge of the fire emergency
   management process into BIM by extending the Industry Foundation Classes
   (IFC) standard and providing a BIM knowledge extraction algorithm using
   the IFC standard, thereby extracting the control strategy from BIM to
   achieve the reasoning of knowledge. Finally, we prototyped BIM-Fire in a
   real building scenario and validated the effectiveness of the method.
   The automatic control of knowledge-driven BIM-based activities is
   realized.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Data-driven green building design in BIM is challenged by the lack of a
   comprehensive data integration framework with the capabilities of
   building life-cycle performance data management and application. This
   paper proposes a performance integrated BIM (P-BIM) framework for
   building life cycle energy efficiency and environment optimization. A
   school building is presented as a case study to verify the P-BIM
   framework and the design optimization workflow established. The results
   show that the optimization can improve IEQ by 11.5\% and reduce LCC by
   36.8\%. The influences of different envelope constructions on indoor
   environment, energy consumptions, and costs are also studied. The P-BIM
   framework and the optimization methodology built on it demonstrate that
   the methodology developed can expand the application scope of BIM and
   contribute to datadriven green building design. More application
   scenarios focusing on the stage of facility management and different
   sustainability performance will be conducted in P-BIM framework in
   future works.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Geographic Information System

   aims to provide a comprehensive, systematic review on data-level BIM/GIS
   integration from the perspective of information flow. Papers from

   collected and analysed. The main outcomes and findings of this review
   are as follows. (1) A unified framework that incorporates all data
   processing tasks for BIM/GIS data integration was developed. (2) Most
   problems regarding BIM-to-GIS data conversion have been solved, which
   enables application-level BIM/GIS integration, while those unsolved
   problems are mainly related to representation transformation and
   semantics mapping. (3) To ensure a fluent information flow, BIM models
   should be more reliable, the conversion paths should be more robust and
   efficient, and a more flexible data model on the GIS side is in need.},

Title = {Developing a framework to revolutionise the 4D BIM process: IPD-based
   solution},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {401-420},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The integration of building information modelling (BIM) and integrated
   project delivery (IPD) is highly recommended for better project
   delivery. Although there is a methodology for this integration, the BIM
   requires some improvements to foster the adoption of IPD. The purpose of
   this paper is to present an innovative way to support 4D BIM
   automation/optimisation within the IPD approach. Similar to structural
   and architectural design libraries, this research proposes a planning
   library to enable automating the formulation of schedule, as well as
   embedding the multi-objective optimisation into the 4D BIM.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The literature review was used to highlight the existing attempts to
   support the automation process for 4D BIM and the multi-objective
   schedule optimisation for construction projects. A case study was done
   to validate the developed framework and measure its applicability.
   Findings
   The results show that there is a cost-saving of 22.86 per cent because
   of using the proposed automated multi-objective optimisation. The case
   study shows the significance of integrating activity-based costing into
   4D BIM to configure the hierarchy level of overhead activities with the
   IPD approach; therefore, the maximum level of contribution in managing
   the IPD project is 33.33 per cent by the trade package level and the
   minimum contribution is around 8.33 per cent by the project level.
   Originality/value
   This research presents a new philosophy to develop the 4D BIM model -
   planning and scheduling - a BIM library of the project activities is
   developed to enable the automation of the creation of the project
   schedule with respect to the 3D BIM design sequence. The optimisation of
   the project duration is considered to be automated within the creation
   process by using the proposed genetic algorithm model.},

Abstract = {Purpose Effective use of post-occupancy evaluation (POE) data -
   quantitative physical measurements and qualitative occupants'
   perceptions are limited due to practical challenges and research gaps.
   Although building information modelling (BIM) has enabled a paradigm
   shift in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC)
   industries, its use in facility management (FM) is still infancy.
   Limited research has used building performance data to enable changes to
   BIM models for the benefit of FM. This paper aims to propose the
   innovative process to collect and contextualize two fragmented types of
   POE data sets by filling methodological gap in POE research. Moreover,
   it presents innovative modelling techniques to facilitate BIM as a more
   effective platform to visualize such currently fragmented data sets in
   real-time while enabling a decision-making model to benefit facility
   managers. Design/methodology/approach The paper presents a process of
   capturing cloud-based POE data, both wireless sensor network-based
   physical measurement data and mobile app-based occupant perception data.
   Real-time capture and visualization of such building performance data
   was demonstrated through a pilot data collection. Subsequently, the
   innovative visualization of the cloud connected data is supported by a
   prototype game engine-based BIM model. Findings Cloud-based POE data,
   both quantitative physical measurements and qualitative occupants'
   reported perceptions, can be effectively used in FM practice with the
   use of innovative data capture and visualization techniques in a
   beneficial manner for facility operation and management decisions. This
   paper also demonstrates the ability of BIM to serve as a ``single source
   of truth{''} to support post-construction building performance data.
   Originality/value While addressing a number of research gaps, the paper
   provides a holistic approach to BIM-based performance monitoring for
   smart FM to achieve the ultimate vision of BIM enabled FM. The
   innovative system is expected to provide a powerful and practical tool
   for data collection, analysis and visualization for intelligent facility
   management decision making. This paper contributes to fill an important
   research and practice gap in the area of next generation smart building
   management practices.},

Abstract = {Data-driven digital transformation is becoming increasingly relevant.
   Building information modelling (BIM) and geographic information systems
   (GIS) are two technologies specific to the construction industry. The
   two approaches are different, but complementary. In this article,
   BIM-GIS integration is approached from some of the most relevant
   aspects, such as standardization or level of detail, and a comparison
   between both approaches is presented with the aim of improving the
   operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure. By means of the
   Madrid Calle 30 ring road as a case study, the integration of the BIM
   model of the road in a GIS scenario using the IFC and SLPK formats is
   shown. The information is stored in an external database, which allows
   updates without modifying the 3D model and facilitates the inclusion of
   real-time data. The study highlights the challenges of interoperability

Abstract = {The global trends related to the concept of Metaverse in architecture
   have significantly expanded in recent years, thanks to the increasing
   number of scientific publications. Systematically examining the
   literature on this topic and identifying research trends and potential
   directions provides comprehensive data maps, thus charting a roadmap for
   researchers interested in working in this field. In this context, the
   research aims to identify the trends and tendencies of the concept of
   the Metaverse in the scientific literature over time at the primary
   analysis levels, such as countries, institutions, resources, articles,
   authors, and research topics. The research conducted with this aim
   involves a dynamic, visual, and systematic examination of the academic
   literature on academic publishing using data accessed without year
   limitations from the Web of Science Core Collection-Citation database.
   In the research conducted without year limitations, a sample comprising
   334 articles published/planned to be published between 2005 and 2024 is
   analyzed. The bibliometrix R-Tool was used to enhance the analysis, and
   metadata was obtained from the WoS database. This analysis analyzed
   publications, citations, and information sources, including the most
   published journals, the most used keywords, the most cited and leading
   articles, the most cited academics, and the most contributing
   institutions and countries. In conclusion, this study aims to define the
   profile of international academic publishing in the field of the
   Metaverse, present its development, identify research fronts, detect
   emerging trends, and uncover the working themes and trends in the
   Metaverse specific to architecture. This study describes the profile of
   international academic publishing on the metaverse, presents its
   development, identifies research frontiers, identifies emerging trends,
   and reveals metaverse study themes and trends in architecture. As a
   result, education, virtual perception of space, building operation and
   maintenance, building evacuation, BIM (Building Information Modeling),
   cultural heritage, physical environment, built environment/planning,
   smart home, design and creativity, universal design/accessibility,
   sustainability, smart city/GIS, urban transportation systems, and in-use
   evaluation are identified as themes that have been studied in relation
   to the metaverse concept in architecture and design disciplines.},

Title = {A critical review of digital value engineering in building design
   towards automated construction},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 12},
Abstract = {Value engineering (VE) has the potential to increase sustainability in
   buildings by optimizing function-to-cost ratios. However, outdated
   manual procedures limit integration and consistency in construction
   projects, necessitating the evaluation of VE automation. This review
   examines VE automation in building design and construction. A systematic
   analysis of 664 publications from major databases was conducted,
   yielding 136 relevant articles. Bibliometric analysis using descriptive
   statistics and keyword mapping identified key VE methodologies and
   building types. Key technologies in VE automation include BIM, advanced
   algorithms, and data integration. These tools enable automated layout
   generation, material selection, and technical configurations, enhancing
   value optimization. BIM serves as a central data platform, improving
   stakeholder collaboration. Algorithms rapidly generate design
   alternatives, optimizing decision-making. Data integration ensures
   accuracy across project stages. Challenges include incomplete databases,
   lifecycle integration issues, and resistance to change. A continuous
   digital VE framework is proposed to address these barriers. This
   framework emphasizes the seamless integration of VE tools with BIM
   platforms, enhancing interoperability and user engagement. In the
   future, there will be further opportunities to advance VE automation
   through the creation of more advanced predictive analytics algorithms,
   more real-time data processing capabilities, and increased
   interoperability amongst various digital tools. The integration of
   machine learning and artificial intelligence into VE processes is also
   suggested to further enhance optimization and efficiency in construction
   projects.},

Title = {A tool based on the industry foundation classes standard for dynamic
   data collection and automatic generation of building automation control
   networks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The use of Building Automation and Control Networks (BACN) is becoming
   increasingly wide spread, largely due to the benefits to end-users and
   energy management companies of controlling the systems installed in
   buildings. At the same time, the digitalisation of buildings is
   increasing every day with the adoption of technologies such as Building
   Information Modelling (BIM), allowing a high level of digital control in
   all phases of the building life cycle. However, although the use of BIM
   is spreading to obtain a digital model of the building, it is not very
   common to include the existing control systems in BIM models. The
   integration of BACN-to-BIM seems to be the most appropriate process to
   have all the information of a building, as it would allow to digitalise
   and connect both the geometric and the logical part, but it is a
   challenge to be faced in terms of interoperability. This paper shows the
   BACN2BIM tool, a tool to make it easier for technical users the creation
   of monitoring networks linked to BIM models of a building, based on
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. The BACN2BIM tool will allow
   owners and technical users to easily download dynamic monitoring data,
   real-time data of the measurements obtained from devices installed in
   their buildings (temperature, humidity, energy consumption, CO2
   concentration, etc.) The tool has been tested in a case study and in a
   real demo case located in Spain, showing a time reduction in updating a
   BIM model with the devices of an existing monitoring system and in the
   download of existing monitoring data.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced infrastructure
   monitoring, particularly through machine learning and deep learning
   techniques. In bridge management, combining AI with Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enhances accuracy,
   efficiency, and safety. This paper reviews AI, UAV, and BIM
   applications, focusing on technology integration and algorithm
   performance. A systematic literature review using the PRISMA framework
   analyzed 4436 papers from Scopus and Web of Science. Findings indicate
   that AI is mainly applied to damage detection, primarily through
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), while UAVs provide high-resolution
   imaging, and BIM serves as a platform for data storage and
   visualization. Key challenges include the lack of standardized datasets,
   limited automation in decision-making, and weak interoperability among
   these technologies. Future research should focus on dataset
   availability, hybrid AI models, and integrated automation strategies.
   This review highlights key areas to enhance AI-based bridge management.},

Title = {BIM-Based Building Geometric Modeling and Automatic Generative Design
   for Sustainable Offsite Construction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {148},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Offsite construction is gaining attention due to government policies
   promoting automation and productivity. Therefore, understanding the
   impact of building design on construction cost and the carbon footprint
   associated with offsite construction is important for the improved
   sustainability and climate resilience of the built environment. This
   study aims to develop a system approach, with the aid of building
   information modeling (BIM), for 3D geometric modeling and automatic
   generative design toward optimizing the carbon footprint and
   construction cost from offsite construction. A mathematical formulation
   is proposed to represent the topological relationships between different
   kinds of precast and cast-in-situ elements, which in turn, underpin 3D
   geometric modeling for possible geometric variations within precast
   buildings. New generative algorithms are developed to automatically
   manipulate building geometrics subject to pre-defined constraints, and
   create parametric BIM models in compliance with material types assigned
   by users. A BIM-based automation tool is developed to extract and match
   the model geometry/material information with a customized BIM object
   library, through which carbon emission factors and cost coefficients can
   be retrieved for multi-criteria sustainability analysis. The proposed
   new approach empowers 3D geometric modeling and geometry-based design
   automation, which enable comprehensive exploration of design alternates
   in precast construction. The proposed new method is illustrated via a
   case study that investigates the impact of different design variations
   on embodied carbon and construction cost of precast structures. The
   proposed BIM development takes around 30 minutes to create 1,000-1,500
   new design options. Besides, it produces design options that contain a
   30\% less carbon footprint and construction cost than reference
   buildings from the literature. The results indicate that our proposed
   method can support automated design exploration at early stages, which
   help to identify optimal solutions for more informed decision making.},

Volume = {24},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {33-48},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to introduce a new methodology for generating
   synthetic images for facility management purposes. The method starts by
   leveraging the existing 3D open-source BIM models and using them inside
   a graphic engine to produce a photorealistic representation of indoor
   spaces enriched with facility-related objects. The virtual environment
   creates several images by changing lighting conditions, camera poses or
   material. Moreover, the created images are labeled and ready to be
   trained in the model. Design/methodology/approachThis paper focuses on
   the challenges characterizing object detection models to enrich digital
   twins with facility management-related information. The automatic
   detection of small objects, such as sockets, power plugs, etc., requires
   big, labeled data sets that are costly and time-consuming to create.
   This study proposes a solution based on existing 3D BIM models to
   produce quick and automatically labeled synthetic images. FindingsThe
   paper presents a conceptual model for creating synthetic images to
   increase the performance in training object detection models for
   facility management. The results show that virtually generated images,
   rather than an alternative to real images, are a powerful tool for
   integrating existing data sets. In other words, while a base of real
   images is still needed, introducing synthetic images helps augment the
   model's performance and robustness in covering different types of
   objects. Originality/valueThis study introduced the first pipeline for
   creating synthetic images for facility management. Moreover, this paper
   validates this pipeline by proposing a case study where the performance
   of object detection models trained on real data or a combination of real
   and synthetic images are compared.},

Abstract = {Process digitalisation and automation is unstoppable in all industries,
   including construction. However, its widespread adoption, even for
   non-experts, demands easy-to-use tools that reduce technical
   require-ments. BIM to BEM (Building Energy Models) workflows are a clear
   example, where ad-hoc prepared models are needed. This paper describes a
   methodology, based on graph techniques, to automate it by highly
   reducing the input BIM requirements found in similar approaches, being
   applicable to almost any IFC. This is especially relevant in
   retrofitting, where reality capture tools (e.g., 3D laser scanning,
   object recognition in drawings) are prone to create geometry clashes and
   other inconsistencies, posing higher challenges for automation. Another
   innovation presented is its multi-scale nature, efficiently addressing
   the surroundings impact in the energy model. The application to selected
   test cases has been successful and further tests are ongoing,
   considering a higher variety of BIM models in relation to tools and
   techniques used and model sizes.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Facilities Management (FM) at airports involves the use of systems such
   as Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS). Currently, the
   integration of BIM with CMMS is yet to reach maturity, resulting in the
   inability to reuse BIM data produced prior to the operations and
   maintenance phase. The lack of accurate and untimely handover of
   equipment data contributes to failed CMMS programs. The studied airport
   had a low CMMS utilization resulting from a lack of equipment data from
   recent and old construction projects and lacked an efficient process for
   acquiring, storing, and exchanging asset data from construction into its
   CMMS. To address this, the airport sought for solutions to reuse BIM
   data in the CMMS. Utilizing a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology,
   this research proposed and tested a solution technology innovation
   comprising a BIM-FM integration framework and structured workflow based
   on BIM and COBie for FM data delivery into a CMMS. The proposed solution
   was tested on a real-world project at the airport: showing efficacy to
   provide the required equipment data in a timely and accurate manner as
   compared to the existing practice. The study provides practical evidence
   of application of BIM and COBie in FM data delivery from a handover
   perspective.},

Title = {A BIM-Based Value for Money Assessment in Public-Private Partnership: An
   Overall Review},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have proliferated and adapted to
   public development in recent decades; within it, the value for money
   (VfM) assessment defines the feasibility of the project procurement
   model as one of the essential components of PPP. However, evaluating the
   VfM in PPPs remains problematic. Given concerns about PPP profitability,
   a more integrated VfM evaluation is urgently needed to manage multiple
   indicators along the project lifecycle. Building information management
   (BIM), popular in architecture, engineering, and construction, provides
   resources that could support the VfM to a great extent. This paper uses
   a review approach to identify the current issues that are affecting VfM
   assessments and suggests that BIM, functioning throughout the PPP
   lifecycle, could support decision-making in VfM processes in order to
   satisfy service targets.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to summarize the current
   applications of BIM, the integration of related technologies and the
   tendencies and challenges systematically. Design/methodology/approach
   Using quantitative and qualitative bibliometric statistical methods, the
   current mode of interaction between BIM and other related technologies
   is summarized. Findings This paper identified 24 different BIM
   applications in the life cycle. From two perspectives, the
   implementation status of BIM applications and integrated technologies
   are respectively studied. The future industry development framework is
   drawn comprehensively. We summarized the challenges of BIM applications
   from the perspectives of management, technology and promotion, and
   confirmed that most of the challenges come from the two driving factors
   of promotion and management. Research limitations/implications The
   technical challenges reviewed in this paper are from the collected
   literature we have extracted, which is only a part of the practical
   challenges and not comprehensive enough. Practical implications We
   summarized the current mode of interactive use of BIM and sorted out the
   challenges faced by BIM applications to provide reference for the risks
   and challenges faced by the future industry. Originality/value There is
   little literature to integrate BIM applications and to establish BIM
   related challenges and risk frameworks. In this paper, we provide a
   review of the current implementation level of BIM and the risks and
   challenges of stakeholders through three aspects of management,

Title = {Integrated BIM-GA approach for slab formwork design optimization},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 14},
Abstract = {PurposeFormwork design and construction for reinforced concrete
   buildings take significant time, effort and money. Construction
   procedures are time-consuming for designers and costly for the
   contractor. Poor engineering decisions have led to several workplace
   accidents in the construction industry. This paper aims to present an
   integrated building information modeling - genetic algorithm (BIM-GA)
   model to automate formwork design, 3D visualization and
   optimization.Design/methodology/approachData are precisely extracted
   from a 3D structural model and used to optimize formwork design based on
   available formwork components and prices. Optimization models are made
   using GA approach. A library of 3D formwork components was modeled and
   stored using Revit. The optimized design solution thereafter would be
   visualized automatically in Revit to readily acquire formwork quantities
   schedules and shop drawings.FindingsA case study illustrating the
   proposed approach demonstrated that using BIM will reduce formwork
   design, quantification and drawing time by more than 50\% of the
   traditional approach with safer design and accurate results due to
   process automation and optimize cost for the given
   data.Originality/valueThis research introduces an innovative integrated
   BIM and GA model for the optimization and automation of slab formwork
   design, which has significantly benefited the construction industry. The
   utilization of GA in the optimization process allows for the attainment
   of an optimal formwork design, ultimately leading to a reduction in
   construction cost and time.},

Title = {The contextual information requirements for collection and use of
   occupant feedback in BIM-enabled FM},
Journal = {FACILITIES},

Volume = {42},
Number = {3/4, SI},
Pages = {321-341},
Month = {FEB 26},
Abstract = {PurposeOccupant feedback is crucial for healthy, comfortable and
   productive offices. Existing facility management (FM) systems are
   limited in effective use of occupant feedback, as they fail to collect
   the vital contextual information (e.g. related building element, space)
   associated with the feedback. The purpose of this study is to formalise
   the contextual information requirements for structured collection of
   occupant feedback for rapid diagnosis and resolution of problems and
   integrating occupant feedback with building information modelling (BIM)
   for making use of its visualisation and analysis capabilities, and
   eventually for effective use of occupant feedback in FM
   operations.Design/methodology/approachA mixed-methods approach was
   conducted in four steps: (1) identifying occupant feedback types (e.g.
   echo in meeting room) in office buildings, (2) examining the current
   practice in collecting and processing occupant feedback via use cases,
   (3) determining the contextual information requirements via expert
   interviews and (4) validation of the information requirements via a
   BIM-integrated prototype.FindingsThe findings present the contextual
   information requirements for 107 occupant feedback types grouped under
   thermal comfort, indoor air quality, acoustic comfort, visual comfort,
   building design and facility services.Practical
   implicationsFeedback-specific contextual information items enable
   structured data collection and help to avoid missing data and minimise
   the time lost in manual data entry and recursive interaction with the
   occupants during FM operations.Originality/valueThe contextual
   information requirements determined are expected to enhance occupant
   satisfaction and FM performance in office buildings by better use of the
   occupant feedback and integration into BIM-enabled FM and can be
   extended to other building types in future studies by using the proposed
   methodology.},

Abstract = {Facility management (FM) teams routinely deal with numerous tasks,
   tools, and data sources to ensure the buildings they manage function
   properly. This diversity and the organizational complexity of these
   teams increase operational expenses related to interoperability. To
   address this, a methodology integrating BIM with maintenance management
   system logs is investigated herein. It includes two novel ways of
   automatically exchanging and visualizing such data using BIM as a common
   data environment. They provide building operators with greater context
   to expedite the decision-making process. A sequence diagram based on a
   typical facility management organization illustrates that these tools
   improve data exchange efficiency by which the operators understand the
   data and target operational improvements better. This methodology
   reduces the dependency on external programming languages for data
   processing. A text mining workflow is leveraged to process the work
   order (WO) descriptions. The methodology is demonstrated using a case
   study, which indicates that only 47 out of 81 rooms have one or more WOs
   and over 60\% of all WOs are related to five rooms on the top floor. By
   focusing on these spaces, the underlying reasons and patterns of the
   faults were identified, which enhances the productivity of FM teams,
   occupants, and energy efficiency.},

Title = {A BIM-based framework for automated generation of fabrication drawings
   for facade panels},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Many modern commercial buildings involve complex shaped facades,
   resulting in increasing complexity as well as challenges in facade
   manufacturing and assembly processes. Currently, the keys to manufacture
   facade panels are fabrication drawings. However, generating fabrication
   drawings for facade panels using conventional approaches is
   time-consuming and error-prone, especially when the number of facade
   panels gets large. Computer-aided automation can significantly improve
   the efficiency and accuracy of the manufacturing and assembly process,
   while conventional drawing automation processes are not able to
   integrate information from various data sources and optimize drawing
   layouts. In this paper, a BIM-based framework is proposed to facilitate
   the automatic generation of fabrication drawings for facade panels. The
   framework integrates both graphical and non-graphical information from
   BIM models and other external data sources. Specific algorithms are
   applied to obtain proper drawing views and optimize drawing layouts
   based on the BIM geometric models. Complete fabrication drawings as well
   as a tabulated file with essential graphical information on similar
   components are generated automatically. The framework is demonstrated
   using an illustrative example and it shows that time and human effort
   can be significantly reduced. As a result, all the fabrication drawings
   of similar facade panels follow a consistent drawing format with
   explicit layout, leading to higher readability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Augmented reality-based knowledge transfer for facility management: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {98},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Facility management is globally recognized as a critical and
   knowledge-intensive field. It confronts challenges due to the increasing
   complexity of facilities and the vast amount of operation and
   maintenance information. Augmented reality (AR), emerges as a promising
   technology to address these challenges by enhancing knowledge transfer
   in facility management through immersive and interactive environments.
   The objective of this research is to conduct a systematic review of
   augmented reality applications in facility management, and explore its
   knowledge transfer capabilities in facility management. The review
   narrowed the literature by filtering from 618 publications to 107 papers
   published between 2011 and 2023. A contents analysis based on these
   articles could gain an insight into current facility management systems
   as well as augmented reality application domains in a series of facility
   management activities including facility design/layout, assembly,
   monitoring, maintenance and renovation. Based on the above analysis,
   this research discussed the augmented reality capabilities of knowledge
   transfer in facility management. The findings reveal that augmented
   reality facilitates knowledge transfer by enabling visualization,
   interaction, and collaboration among stakeholders. It is influenced by
   factors including user interfaces and interaction types, as well as
   vocational training and acceptance level of stakeholders. Challenges
   remain in terms of tracking, registration, ergonomics, security, and
   management practices. Finally, this research highlighted future trends
   focusing on the development of knowledge-driven digital twins,
   trustworthy knowledge management, and collaborative platforms to further
   promote augmented reality knowledge transfer in facility management.
   This research also contributes to deeper understanding of the role of
   augmented reality within this field and provides insights for
   stakeholders aiming to utilize this technology.},

Title = {BIM-based life cycle assessment for different structural system
   scenarios of a residential building},
Journal = {AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study pinpoints the benefit of integrating Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) and Building information modelling (BIM) for different design
   scenarios of a residential building's structural system; (1) reinforced
   concrete solid slab system, (2) steel and (3) composite structural
   system. The environmental impacts for each scenario are evaluated,
   providing insights into the contribution of (1) building life cycle
   stages, (2) structural systems and (3) building materials. Construction
   cost and time were also assessed and compared for each. The results show
   how LCA-BIM integration can streamline the environmental stewardship and
   prioritize action; showing that the building operation stage, the steel
   structural system, slabs and beams as well as reinforced concrete have
   the highest environmental impact, respectively. Hence, this calls for
   acting on building operation as well as the proper design of building
   elements and selection of building materials to reduce the associated
   environmental burden resulting from the building process. (c) 2022 THE

Title = {BIM-enabled computerized design and digital fabrication of
   industrialized buildings: A case study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {278},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Industrialized construction leverages factory-based manufacturing and
   lean-site assembly to achieve higher industrial efficiency. Building
   information modeling (BIM) offers new opportunities to underpin the
   computerized design and fabrication of industrialized buildings,
   providing greater productivity and cost-effectiveness. In this study,
   attempts are made to review the state-of-the-art BIM applications on
   design and prefabrication automation of industrialized buildings, with
   more emphasis on the recent achievement in concrete 3D printing
   technology. Following this, a BIM method is proposed to support the
   detailed geometry design and digital fabrication of modular housings. A
   program interfaced within BIM is developed and demonstrated through
   discussions on its capacity in generating the geometry details of
   3D-printed modules. In addition, robotic simulation of 3D printing is
   performed to explore a flexible plan in producing the 3D-printed modules
   or components. The lessons learned from the study are discussed to
   highlight the future research challenges and opportunities. First, as
   current Industry Foundation Classes-based BIM model provides limited
   support to prefabrication, research on BIM open standards demands more
   attentions to interoperate the computerized design and computer-aided
   manufacturing. Moreover, today's industrialized buildings consist of
   sophisticated architectural, structural, and mechanical systems that are
   intervened across the whole life cycle, more research on the
   interdependent building systems is needed (via digital twins) to
   optimize the life cycle performance. When moving towards data-driven
   decision making, there are research needs to expand Internet of Things
   and Artificial Intelligence to collect the big data from prefabrication,
   perform predictive analysis, and optimize the control decisions for
   manufacturing facilities operations. This study illustrates the process
   and future work in BIM design and prefabrication automation that can
   assist practitioners to enhance the quality of industrialized
   construction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Exploring the Role of BIM in Construction Safety in Developing
   Countries: Toward Automated Hazard Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Safety is a well-researched yet underperforming management aspect of the
   construction industry. Building information modeling (BIM) can help, and
   some frameworks have addressed safety management in limited phases of
   the project lifecycle. This study positions BIM centrally in the safety
   management process and develops a safety management framework that
   covers the entire lifecycle of a construction project in the context of
   developing countries. A systematic literature review is conducted to
   identify the safety factors and BIM features that are synthesized to
   devise BIM-based safety improvement strategies. The strategies are
   presented to construction management professionals from developed and
   developing countries through an online questionnaire survey, and their
   level of agreement is identified. Afterward, construction safety experts
   are engaged to integrate these strategies into appropriate lifecycle
   phases. Additionally, these experts are also engaged to develop an
   automated hazard recognition process to leverage BIM potential in safety
   management. The integration of strategies into project lifecycle phases
   resulted in a comprehensive safety implementation framework leveraging
   the BIM platform. This framework takes a lead from the experience of
   developed countries and considers the limitations of developing
   countries in terms of resources and technology. Furthermore, a BIM-based
   process map for hazard identification is developed. The process map
   takes the BIM model as input and provides a detailed safety report. The
   process map can be automated to enhance effective safety management.
   This study expands the body of knowledge through a BIM-driven lifecycle
   safety management framework for developing countries where BIM adoption
   is still in its early stages. It is a fresh take on safety automation to
   make the construction industry safer and more reliable. However, it is
   limited due to inadequate safety reporting and documentation in
   developing countries. Future research can improve upon this limitation
   by positioning in a safety-compliant culture.},

Pages = {174-192},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The building information modelling (BIM) methodology supports
   collaborative works, based on the centralization of all information in a
   federated BIM model and on an efficient level of interoperability
   between BIM-based platforms. Concerning the structure design, the
   interoperability capacity of the most used software presents limitations
   that must be identified and alternative solutions must be proposed. This
   study analyzes the process of transfer of structure models between
   modeling and structure analysis tools. Distinct building cases were
   performed in order to recognize the type of limitations verified in the
   transfer processes concerning two-way data flow between several
   software. The study involves the modeling software ArchiCAD 2020, Revit
   2020, and AECOsim 2019 and the structure analyzes tools SAP 2020, Robot
   2020, and ETABS 22020. The transfer processes are realized in two ways:
   using the native data format; using a universal standard data transfer,
   the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. The level of maturity of
   BIM in structure design is still relatively low, caused essentially by
   interoperability problems, but despite the limitations detected, this
   study shows throughout the development of several building case, that
   the methodology has clear advantages in the development of the structure
   project.},

Abstract = {This paper presents and analyses two distinct Building Information
   Models (BIM) developed for the same heritage building, the Chalet of the
   Countess of Edla, located in Sintra, Portugal. This building,
   incorpo-rated in 1995 in the UNESCO's World Heritage List within the
   Cultural Landscape of Sintra, was severely damaged by fire in 1999, and
   two distinct BIM-based solutions were developed afterwards, in 2009 and
   2020. The instances followed two approaches, the first being a
   rehabilitation-oriented digital represen-tation, while the second is a
   centralized resource for building maintenance. In this study the
   distinct features and characteristics of both models are discussed,
   highlighting the importance of information transfer from the model set
   up during the reconstruction to the later, which was surveyed to
   document the ``as-built{''} construction. An example of this is the
   complementarity between the two models, which allowed the incorporation
   of building features, including non-visible constructive elements, from
   the first model into the management-oriented BIM. (c) 2021 Elsevier

Title = {A Seven-Dimensional Building Information Model for the Improvement of
   Construction Efficiency},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {With the fast expansion of major cities in China, increasing scale,
   complex, and tall buildings have been built to meet the increasing
   commercial and living demand. However, the efficiency of project
   management and investment is not always satisfactory. To solve this
   problem, a seven-dimensional building information model (7D BIM) is
   developed. To do this, a 3D BIM is firstly developed, which consists of
   architecture model, equipment model, steel framework model, other solid
   models, etc. Then, a 1D schedule management model and a 3D project
   management model (bidding management, enterprise quota management, and
   process management) have been integrated into the 3D BIM, thus forming a
   7D BIM for a complex project. By providing a clear 3D vision in modeling
   the construction process, the proposed 7D model can be applied to help
   engineers/project managers carry out clash detection, structure design,
   modification, equipment installation, 3D project management, and
   maintenance after construction. The performance of this model has been
   demonstrated through a case study of a complex project launched in
   China. The study shows that the implementation of the 7D BIM has
   achieved significant cost and time saving as well as project quality and
   work efficiency improvement.},

Abstract = {Infrastructure Asset Management (InfraAM)/Facilities Management (FM)
   which deals with infrastructure maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation
   needs an urgent focus on technology-based solutions. This can be done by
   implementing digital technologies, like Building Information Modelling
   (BIM), that can help in 3D visualization, 4D scheduling, 5D costing, 6D
   sustainability, and 7D FM throughout the service life of the project.
   However, BIM's implementation undergoes various challenges and to
   understand the critical challenges, a systematic literature review (SLR)
   was conducted using 89 peer-reviewed papers from three databases, and
   quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. The literature
   revealed the critical challenges (CCs) and success factors (SFs) that
   influence BIM implementation for FM but lacks an interrelationship
   between them. Hence, the current study linked various CCs and SFs
   through a theoretical approach. The study found that the role of
   government and contractual frameworks can help to eliminate the majority
   of the challenges. This novel approach could provide significant
   contributions by helping practitioners and policymakers understand the
   connections between CCs and the role of SFs as potential solutions for
   enhancing BIM implementation for FM.},

Abstract = {The latest industrial revolution 4 enabled significant performance
   improvement through technological advancements. Simultaneously, the
   industry is setting high-level expectations for changing business
   practices toward long-term benefits in all three sustainability
   dimensions. The concept of sustainability embraces all production and

   sustainability with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) technologies in the AEC industry and the
   sustainability vision for their integration. The different types of ERP
   and BIM implementations have similarities in addressing the broad scope
   of functionalities. The emergence and proliferation of ERP and BIM have
   brought crucial changes to the business environment. Further evolution
   to cloud-based operations is transforming companies from
   technology-oriented practices to data-centric decision-making smart
   infrastructures. The narrative literature review investigates the
   sustainability insights and ideas in ERP and BIM solutions, presenting
   state of the art on systems integration topics. The relevant literature

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 19},
Abstract = {Purpose - Facility management gained profound importance due to the
   increasing complexity of different systems and the cost of operation and
   maintenance. However, due to the increasing complexity of different
   systems, facility managers may suffer from a lack of information. The
   purpose of this paper is to propose a new facility management approach
   that links segmented assets to the vital data required for managing
   facilities.Design/methodology/approach - Automatic point cloud
   segmentation is one of the most crucial processes required for modelling
   building facilities. In this research, laser scanning is used for point
   cloud acquisition. The research utilises region growing algorithm,
   colour-based region-growing algorithm and Euclidean cluster
   algorithm.Findings - A case study is worked out to test the accuracy of
   the considered point cloud segmentation algorithms utilising metrics
   precision, recall and F-score. The results indicate that Euclidean
   cluster extraction and region growing algorithm revealed high accuracy
   for segmentation.Originality/value - The research presents a comparative
   approach for selecting the most appropriate segmentation approach
   required for accurate modelling. As such, the segmented assets can be
   linked easily with the data required for facility management.},

Abstract = {For effective pre-construction process, engineers create a 4D building
   information model (BIM). However, the rich information associated with
   the creation of the 4D BIM leads to manual effort. Past studies explored
   methods that automatically generate construction schedules using 3D
   building models. However, no method properly utilized relationships
   between building elements to robustly generate 4D BIMs that are
   structural stable during installation. This research presents an
   approach to the automated generation of structurally stable construction
   sequences using a 3D BIM. Focusing on steel erection, we create a
   framework integrating a 3D BIM and algorithms to create a 4D BIM with
   detailed steel erection sequences of individual elements. This research
   explores an approach to a variation of static indeterminacy for each
   installation process of steel elements. The principle of this approach
   is based on the relationships among the nodes and the connections among
   steel elements, information about which is available to those involved
   in the project. For validation, we test a prototype software program
   using a BIM for a real-world construction project. The results indicate
   that the prototype utilizing the static indeterminacy variation could
   generate a large number of random sequences and successfully transforms
   them into stable sequences. This study establishes the foundational step
   of generating constructible sequences using structural information in
   BIM which is found to be more robust than previous approaches, and
   results of this study can lead to follow up studies for full automation
   such as automated analysis and optimization of the sequences.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {One main gap in the automation of construction quantity takeoff (QTO) is
   the lack of a systematic method to address building information models
   (BIMs) created from different BIM authoring tools and workflows. Even
   the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), one of the ISO standard data
   schema, have been used in a variety of ways, some of which could be
   proprietary. To address this gap, the authors proposed a new data-driven
   reverse engineering algorithm development (D-READ) method for developing
   QTO algorithms based on IFC geometric analysis. The proposed method
   enables the development of QTO algorithms for IFC-based BIMs resulting
   from different BIM authoring tools and workflows, and therefore it
   enhances robustness of BIM-based QTO. It takes a novel bottom-up
   approach in QTO algorithm development compared to the traditional
   top-down approach. A model view definition (MVD) model for IFC model
   checking was developed and incorporated with the QTO algorithms. The
   proposed method was tested on nine different BIM instance models from
   different sources. A comparison with the state-of-the-art commercial
   software showed consistent QTO results, whereas the proposed D-READ
   method resulted in QTO algorithms that were more robust with regard to
   the different BIM authoring tools and workflows used.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe era of digital construction, including building information
   modelling (BIM), has placed a high demand for a seamless collaboration
   of people, technology and processes in meeting a project delivery. The
   project actors involved in a BIM process must ensure compliance with all
   regulations and contractual requirements from inception. While many
   studies have disclosed the various contractual implications arising from
   BIM implementation, little has been examined on the current state of BIM
   in contract administration practice, particularly in the Malaysian
   construction industry. This study aims to explore the current state of
   BIM implementation with specific reference to a design-and-build
   construction project. Design/methodology/approachThe exploratory case
   study involved the construction of a public complex. Semi-structured
   interviews were carried out with the project actors, and document
   analysis was performed on the project's contractual guidelines to derive
   the findings. FindingsFindings from the thematic analysis revealed the
   following five sequences of activities that guided the contract
   administration practices, particularly during the pre-contract and
   post-contract stages of a BIM-based construction project: project
   inception, tendering phase, detailed design, construction and
   preparation for the handing over phase. Most of the activities were
   conducted to deliver the final BIM outputs successfully. Nevertheless,
   some shortcomings were noted in the project monitoring, the validation
   process of the BIM deliverables and the BIM players' competency level in
   fulfilling the specified BIM contractual requirements. Practical
   implicationsThe study contributes to a practical understanding of how
   BIM can affect project administration and how a public client can
   improve contractual risk allocation in future BIM implementation.
   Originality/valueThis paper discloses the current practices of contract
   administration to better understand the impacts of BIM management during
   the pre-contract and post-contract stages of a BIM-based construction
   project.},

Title = {BIM and semantic web-based maintenance information for existing
   buildings},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {116},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In the existing building facilities context, the BIM substantial
   intervention concerning semantics and as-is information based portrayal
   for maintenance requirements is very confined. This confinement stresses
   the challenges associated with the lack and absence of reusing existing
   building facilities, as is domain knowledge. Within this scope, this
   paper proposes a novel approach for existing building facilities
   semantic-enrichment from indoor digital scanning portrayal phase to
   semantics depiction and management phase for renovation, rehabilitation,
   or restoration functions. In this paper, we present an ontological
   system, which relies on integrating the as-is information BIM and
   semantic web technology. The developed approach improves existing
   building facilities, as-is information formalization, and management for
   maintenance purposes. The paper outcome is a semantically integrated
   knowledge-based framework that can potentially: 1) constitute a semantic
   database for building facilities components as-is information using BIM;
   2) overcome the lack and absence of retrieving and reusing building
   facilities as-is domain information; and (3) formalize the building
   facilities as-is knowledge in a computable way.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM), as an effective digital method of
   information representation in the field of construction engineering,
   helps to deal with a series of works including design optimization,
   construction planning, and facility management. BIM enhances
   sustainability through energy simulations, material selection, waste
   reduction, and energy monitoring. However, challenges like talent
   shortage, interoperability issues, data management, and lack of
   standardization hinder its widespread use. Current research lacks
   systematic exploration of BIM's application in green buildings' life
   cycle, limiting further development. To fill this research gap, this
   study aims to provide a systematic review of the application of BIM in
   the design, construction and operation stages of the whole life cycle of
   green buildings. As a guideline to conduct this research, the preferred
   reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) model
   are used to identify the main procedures for literature screening and
   review. Through the systematic review, the main applications of BIM
   technology in green buildings are summarized, while the challenges in
   the current applications and the corresponding solutions are discussed.
   Finally, the study proposes key points for the future development of BIM
   to help the construction industry truly realize the development of man
   and nature and harmony and greenery.},

Abstract = {This study presents an analysis of the potential uses of BIM for
   managing the maintenance and refurbishment of existing housing assets to
   propose thermal comfort and energy efficiency guidelines for future
   social housing projects in Brazil. To do so, a case study analysis of a
   residential development with social-environmental certification in the
   city of Garanhuns, Pernambuco, Brazil was performed, and a literature
   review on the use of BIM for residential unit maintenance was conducted.
   The standard house in the residential development was found to be
   noncompliant with the Brazilian standard for ventilation openings (NBR
   15.220). Therefore, three alternative layouts were created and analyzed
   to meet the requirements of the standard as well as the needs of the
   residents. The authors recommend that socio-environmental certifiers use
   BIM models so that energy performance and other simulations can be
   carried out. The study also proposes guidelines for BIM implementation
   in future government housing projects. These guidelines were grouped
   into five categories: BIM encouragement, energy efficiency, maintenance
   management, user requirement management, and continuous improvement. The
   significance of this study is in providing a path for the gradual
   implementation of BIM for maintenance and post-occupancy management in
   the Brazilian housing program.},

Title = {An XML-based approach for geo-semantic data exchange from BIM to VR
   applications},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) have been
   steadily growing over the past decade and found practical applications
   in project planning, design review and construction planning analysis
   particularly in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and
   Facility Management (AEC/FM) industry. However, data exchange between
   BIM and VR is a complex and time consuming process, which has limited VR
   applications in practice. To address this challenge, this research
   proposes a novel method that enables an efficient interoperability of
   BIM and VR including geometry of each element along with required
   semantic data of the BIM model. In this method, geometry and semantic
   data are extracted from BIM models through an Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) file, which is then optimized to be efficiently imported and
   recreated into the VR environment. The backward communication is
   performed by converting XML file to IFC, which is then imported to the
   BIM application. A prototype was developed to implement the proposed
   methodology. A building case study was used to demonstrate the
   capability of the method including considerably short transfer time,
   high quality rendering and geo-semantic data exchange for design and
   construction. These capabilities promote VR applications in the AEC/FM
   industry as the required information for design and construction plan
   review including Architectural parameter (e.g., material, texture and
   dimensions), Engineering parameters (e.g., loads, R-Value), cost,
   schedule and clashes can be exchanged between BIM and VR in near real
   time.},

Title = {Key functions in BIM-based AR platforms},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {150},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The integration of Augmented Reality and Building Information Modelling
   is a promising area of research; however, fragmentation in literature
   hinders the development of mature BIM-based AR platforms. This paper
   aims to minimise the fragmentation in the literature by identifying the
   key functions that represent the essential capabilities of BIM-AR
   platforms. A systematic literature review is employed to identify,
   categorise, and discuss the key functions. The outcome of this paper
   identifies six key functions: positioning (P), interaction (I),
   visu-alisation (V), collaboration (C), automation (A), and integration
   (T). These key functions act as the foundation for an evaluation
   framework that can assist practitioners, developers, and researchers
   with assessing the re-quirements of the targeted application area, and
   hence be better informed on the appropriate devices, software, and
   techniques to use. Finally, this paper emphasises the importance of
   industrial-academic collaboration in BIM -AR research and suggests
   prospects for automation through the application of artificial

Abstract = {Recent critiques of the BIM literature describe it as largely devoid of
   critical theoretical perspectives and theorization capable of explaining
   the nature of change in work practices in a holistic manner. In
   response, the authors argue that, from a theoretical standpoint,
   implementing BIM within professional work practices (as activity
   systems) induces their evolution through dysfunctions created within the
   systems and their resolution. Cases of professional organizations in
   South Africa that have implemented BIM within their organization and in
   multi-organizational projects helped to develop new theoretical insights
   into how professional work practices evolve using activity theory-based
   re-description of the data. Changes in professional work practices were
   analyzed sequentially within the framework, confirming theoretical
   propositions and revealing the dynamics between and within the
   interconnected system of actors, their object, tools, rules guiding
   work, roles they assume and the stakeholders. Essentially, the findings
   imply that the implementation of BIM significantly changes work
   practices within organizations, but gradually and over time. This
   supports an evolutionary, rather than a radical or revolutionary, view
   of BIM-induced change. This theoretical perspective could explain future
   dimensions of change in professional work practices involving BIM, and
   indeed similar work mediating tools.},

Abstract = {Purpose BIM has much potential to improve the effectiveness of
   construction works with respect to design, construction and maintenance.
   However, many Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) firms
   are still lagging in the adoption and implementation of BIM in both
   developing and developed countries. The purpose of this study is to
   assess the barriers to BIM implementation, and examine the ways forward
   to improve BIM adoption within the Nigerian AEC firms.
   Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review and
   questionnaire survey were used in the study. The survey targeted four
   different AEC firms. These include architectural firms, facility
   management firms, quantity surveying firms and structural engineering
   firms in Lagos, Nigeria. The data obtained were analyzed using mean
   score, standard deviation, Kruskal-Wallis test, and factor analysis.
   Findings The study identified 20 barriers to BIM implementation and
   identified ten ways forward to improve BIM adoption in AEC firms,
   particularly in Nigeria. The relative importance of both the identified
   barriers and the ways forward were gauged. The Kruskal-Wallis tests
   revealed that except for one (out of 20) identified barriers, and one
   (out of 10) identified ways forward; there is no statistical significant
   difference in the perceptions of four different AEC firms. The factor
   analysis result grouped the 20 identified barriers into three major
   factors to include: weak top management support and BIM environment
   related issues; cost of BIM software and training issues; and
   incompatibility, legal, contractual, and culture related issues.
   Originality/value The study findings would inform the decisions of the
   construction stakeholders to make some policy recommendations capable of
   positively influencing the full BIM implementation in AEC firms.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) plays a pivotal role in the
   digitization of facilities management (FM), fundamentally transforming
   the built environment sector. However, managing the change in
   organizations to successfully transition into a BIM-enabled FM system
   remains a significant challenge. To address this, this paper starts with
   a literature review of existing theories and practices of change
   management and digital transformation in the built environment sector.
   Based on the analysis of barriers and strategies identified in the
   literature review, a five-step roadmap for change management in BIM
   adoption is proposed. It includes establishing a change management team,
   conceptualizing the initiative, developing an implementation plan,
   managing the transition phase, and maintaining the change. The roadmap
   aims to guide organizations to effectively adopt BIM for FM, resulting
   in streamlined transition, enhanced operational efficiency, and improved
   asset performance. Further research is needed to validate the proposed
   roadmap and its potential for generalization to other sectors and
   countries.},

Title = {BIM-based decision support system for automated manufacturability check
   of wood frame assemblies},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As offsite construction is increasing in popularity, an increasing
   number of construction products are fabricated in a controlled factory
   environment. Due to the complexity of construction products and the
   rising amount of automation used in the industry, productivity has
   reached a peak because the process planning of manufacturing activities
   is still done manually, for example, building information models (BIM)
   do not provide manufacturing information for construction products.
   Knowing whether a machine can manufacture a construction product defined
   by the BIM model is a critical prerequisite for new products. This paper
   proposes a BIM-based framework for automating the evaluation of machine
   capabilities for the manufacturing of construction-oriented products. By
   identifying intersections of the building elements of the product,
   feasible manufacturing operations are determined, and manufacturing
   locations are calculated. These locations are then compared to the
   manufacturing capabilities of the machine. The proposed approach is
   validated using two wood frame assemblies. The results show that the
   system accurately determines whether a user-selected machine can
   manufacture a construction product pre-designed using BIM software.},

Title = {A Methodological Framework to Optimize Data Management Costs and the
   Hand-Over Phase in Cultural Heritage Projects},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper illustrates a methodological approach to optimize the data
   management process and to reduce costs related to information loss, from
   the preliminary phases to the Facility Management (FM) one. The growing
   concern about sustainability issues has steadily increased attention to
   cultural heritage's key role. Concurrently, Europe promotes the
   application of digital methods for managing interventions both for new
   and existing buildings. The data issue, especially in heritage projects,
   represents a crucial aspect; data-recovering activities or shortages of
   information contribute to relevant expenses and discourage stakeholders.
   The research focuses on how procedures involving digitalization, applied
   to heritage projects, can improve the information workflow, supporting
   the hand-over stage. Although the application of digital techniques has
   recognized advantages, enhancements for optimizing time and cost savings
   are required. The research result is a methodological framework to
   obtain complete heritage as-built deliverables for the management phase.
   The defined structure is applied through a case study approach to the
   restoration of a historical lyric theater. Thus, the as-built model
   represents a database for controlling costs and maintenance procedures.
   In the end, the work provides a tangible contribution to the Heritage
   BIM (HBIM) delivery and can be a starting point for future improvements.},

Title = {A BIM-based intelligent approach to rebar layout optimization for
   reinforced concrete columns},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {99},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {This study aims to address inefficiencies and errors in current manual
   rebar practices within the architecture, engineering, and construction
   (AEC) industry, which contribute to significant rebar waste. The
   Design-Bid-Build (DBB) project delivery method further exacerbates these
   issues by hindering effective stakeholder collaboration. By contrast,
   integrated project delivery and building information modeling (BIM) have
   shown potential for enhanced coordination and waste reduction. Yet, the
   continued reliance on manual rebar modeling in BIM highlights a pressing
   need for intelligent automation. This study presents a novel BIM-based
   algorithm that leverages Dynamo for rebar layout optimization and
   Navisworks for automatic clash detection, integrating rebar optimization
   prior to BIM model creation to minimize data exchange errors. The
   methodology was validated on a continuous-column rebar arrangement,
   supported by a standardized rebar summary sheet to streamline the
   optimization and clash-detection process. Key findings indicate that
   this approach significantly reduces working hours while achieving high
   modeling accuracy compared to traditional manual methods. These results
   highlight the potential of the proposed framework to transform rebar
   layout practices, enabling smart, efficient, and sustainable
   construction through automated clash-free rebar layout generation.},

Title = {Advancing Smart Construction Through BIM-Enabled Automation in
   Reinforced Concrete Slab Design},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has proven to be a valuable
   technology in the fields of architecture, construction management, and
   maintenance management. However, its full implementation in structural
   engineering remains unfulfilled due to the persistent use of outdated
   design methods. Insufficient automation in the design process could lead
   to structural defects, construction rework, and structural clashes, each
   of which can have significant financial implications. Given the inherent
   complexity of large-scale construction projects, manual structural
   design and detailing are challenging tasks and are prone to human
   errors. This paper presents a novel BIM framework that leverages BIM,
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), Python scripting, the IfcOpenShell
   library, and Octave programming to automate the design of reinforced
   concrete (RC) slabs, benefiting design professionals and contractors by
   integrating automated processes into project workflows. The framework
   achieved a 40\% reduction in design time and a 25\% decrease in human
   errors, as demonstrated through case studies. In this study, a 3D
   structural model in BIM software is firstly created, extracting slab
   geometrical data that are linked to Microsoft (MS) Excel/.csv and Octave
   spreadsheets via Python and IfcOpenShell. Midspan and end span moment
   coefficients and floor perimeter data following Indian standards are
   then gathered in Octave, and this information is further processed with
   Python scripts. Octave programming is used to determine the most
   accurate, reliable, and economical design for the slab and its
   detailing. This design information is then pushed back to BIM software
   via FreeCAD using Python coding, which can be used to develop bar
   bending scheduling and 2D drawings of the reinforcement details. The
   proposed framework is validated through case studies, demonstrating its
   effectiveness in reducing design time, minimizing human errors, and
   improving overall project efficiency. The core finding of this research
   is an automated approach that offers a cost-effective and accurate
   solution to the limitations of traditional RC slab design, addressing
   structural errors and reducing rework through seamless BIM integration.
   This research presents a novel contribution to the integration of
   structural design, construction processes, and operational aspects
   within BIM. The findings highlight the potential for further
   advancements in BIM adoption, particularly in addressing the lag in
   structural engineering applications compared to architecture.},

Abstract = {Automation is revolutionizing a number of sectors, including
   construction, by bringing about important technological breakthroughs
   that increase productivity and efficiency. Automation in safety
   procedures is still scarce though. In India, the majority of safety
   procedures are still reactive, manual, and paper-based. This study is a
   component of a broader research project on automated safety screening
   for fall risks enabled by BIM. It entails codification of OSHA rules to
   perform safety checks, placing corrective actions into location, and
   generating reports in a virtual environment. As part of the broader risk
   lifecycle, these tasks are typically completed on-site during the
   various stages of construction. This study, on the other hand, executes
   these steps in a virtual environment in the preconstruction phase. The
   model has been assessed in a pilot study in India and was developed
   especially to address fall hazards from staircases. Through early hazard
   identification and mitigation, the system assists professionals in
   enhancing overall safety performance.},

   digital modelling and simulations. A case study on the 10-story, hybrid
   uses Crystal Nexus skyscraper located in Rajkot shows how Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) and Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV)
   promote sustainability. BIM enabled real-time interference tests and
   design revisions, while BIPV on the facade generated renewable energy,
   minimizing dependence on non-renewable resources. BIM is used in
   lifecycle cost analysis, predictive maintenance, and IoT integration for
   dynamic facility management after occupancy. The study recommends hybrid
   building BIM protocol development due to BIM data standardization and
   stakeholder collaboration issues. BIM and BIPV promise energy-efficient,
   cost-effective, and sustainable urban infrastructure. BIM is used to
   develop, model, and analyze hybrid commercial buildings with BIPV
   systems and vertical gardening. BIM optimizes building performance and
   sustainability by integrating systems. BIPV uses the building envelope
   to harvest solar energy, while vertical planting offers a green facade
   for insulation and energy savings. Restaurants, retail, medical
   facilities, libraries, offices, and parking are part of the hybrid
   design, which uses sustainable materials. A Madhapur Chowk case study
   and survey emphasize the need for optimum hybrid construction. A
   multi-disciplinary, collaborative approach to self-sustaining,
   energy-efficient commercial buildings is examined, along with the
   economic viability and benefits of BIM, BIPV, and green facades. These
   technologies are projected to improve energy efficiency, sustainability,
   and occupant wellness in commercial spaces.},

Abstract = {Defined digital Facilities' Management (FM) systems will contribute to
   the realisation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal
   (SDG) 11. Of the available digital FM systems, Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) for FM, herein referred to as BIM-FM, is the least
   developed. Where BIM-FM varies from existing digital FM tools is its
   advanced 3D visualisation capabilities. A semi-structured literature
   review is undertaken to assess the current implementation of BIM-FM and
   identify opportunities to engender its increased adoption. This paper is
   part of an ongoing piece of research aimed at defining a standard
   methodology for the application of BIM to historically significant
   structures, otherwise known as Historic BIM (HBIM). Two existing
   approaches to BIM-FM, current and developing, are outlined. The
   potential value BIM-FM can provide according to the literature is
   discussed but there exists minimal practical evidence to justify these
   claims. Barriers to its adoption are discussed, with a key underlying
   barrier found to be a lack of defined user requirements. Consequently,
   functional, modelling and information requirements established within
   the literature are identified, and existing attempts at realising the
   requirements are discussed. Six information categories and two
   functional requirements are identified. It is theorised that the
   tendency to utilise simplified geometric models for FM is primarily due
   to software and practical limitations as opposed to actual end user
   needs, and it is suggested that this should be investigated further in
   future work. Attempts at realising BIM-FM user requirements using other
   advanced technologies, primarily Digital Twins, are investigated and
   found to be an area of increasing commonality. A new conception of
   BIM-FM is proposed.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Automating 3D reconstruction of indoor environments is essential for
   scene understanding in Building Information Modeling (BIM). This paper
   addresses the challenge of integrating geometric and material attributes
   in scan-to-BIM processes. A deep learning-based framework is developed
   to automatically extract and integrate geometric and material attributes
   from point clouds, incorporating an enhanced instance segmentation
   network, a material classification model, and an automated BIM
   integration workflow for accurate indoor modeling. The proposed
   framework reconstructs accurate 3D BIM models of space-forming and
   space-occupying elements while preserving key attributes. Experimental
   results show significant improvements in instance segmentation accuracy,
   with reconstructed 3D BIM models achieving over 98 \% correctness and
   completeness, while the material classification model attains a
   point-based weighted F1 - score of 0.973 and an object-based accuracy of
   94.70 \%. These findings advance automated BIM generation, enhancing
   building planning, asset management, and sustainable design while
   inspiring further developments in scan-to-BIM automation.},

Title = {IFC-Based Algorithms for Automated Quantity Takeoff from Architectural
   Model: Case Study on Residential Development Project},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The estimation of construction quantities is a critical aspect of any
   construction project, and accuracy in the quantity takeoff (QTO) process
   is an integral part in achieving project success. Accuracy can be
   improved by automating the QTO process. However, one of the gaps in
   automated QTO is found to be the lack of a platform-ignorant computing
   algorithm regarding different building information modeling (BIM)
   authoring tools. Available BIM-based commercial cost estimation software
   programs such as Autodesk Naviswork, Autodesk QTO, iTWO CostX, Innovaya
   Visual QTO, ConstrucSim, and so forth, are limited in terms of full
   automation, largely because full interoperability across all the
   different applications has not yet been achieved. This paper explores
   interoperable QTO algorithms using industry foundation classes
   (IFC)-based BIM. To evaluate the IFC-based QTO algorithms, a case study
   was conducted on a residential development project in Kalamazoo, MI.
   Comparing with commercial software used in practice, the IFC-based QTO
   algorithms showed consistent results, whereas were more powerful
   regarding their independence from BIM authoring tools in extracting the
   volumetric and areal quantities of building components. The IFC-based
   QTO algorithms processed the different types of building element
   configurations in the residential development project smoothly.
   Furthermore, the QTO algorithms are expected to reduce the manual input
   required in generating QTO through interfacing with IFC data which is
   the ISO international standard for BIM.},

Volume = {26},

Abstract = {Construction projects are usually characterised by their large scale,
   complicated technologies, long periods of time to complete, and
   challenging collaboration efforts. The provision of digital
   representations that combine physical properties with geospatial
   information can help to solve some of these problems. Thus, the current
   study proposes a novel approach of integrating building information
   modelling (BIM) into the geographic information system (GIS) domain as a
   way of combining micro- and macro-level information into a unified
   domain without needing to convert between data standards or use any
   intermediate format. Moreover, this study provides an approach to
   automatic geo-referencing of the BIM model in the GIS domain without
   prior knowledge of the corresponding points. Based on the proposed
   integration approach, an integrated BIM+GIS web-based platform was
   developed that allows various stakeholders access to project information
   from different geographical areas, thereby enhancing information sharing
   and facilitating project management. To evaluate the functions and
   feasibility of the developed platform, it was employed for managing a
   mega construction project. The results indicate that the process of
   integrating BIM into the GIS domain was accurate and effective, and the
   developed platform can help to properly manage a mega-project by
   providing the required information and functions.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The effort towards automation of the building industry processes has
   increased significantly over the last years worldwide. One of the key
   tools in this process is the modeling of buildings using Building
   Information Modeling (BIM). When following fundamental principles, a BIM
   model serves as an up-to-date pool of information. Combining the results
   of effective spatial data collection techniques with the information
   from a BIM model, it is possible to increase the effectiveness of
   as-built documentation of the structures or in-site clash detection
   between the built and planned parts. In this paper, we describe an
   approach for the verification of building structures by comparing the
   as-built model created from point clouds with the as-planned model of
   the building. The point clouds can be collected by laser scanning or
   photogrammetry, while the geometry of the planned (designed) structures
   is derived from the BIM model in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)
   format. The advantage of the approach is that the as-built model is
   created by regression models from point clouds preprocessed by detailed
   segmentation. The deviations from the design and the relative geometry
   (e.g., flatness) of the elements are expressed by signed color maps. The
   presented workflow enables semi-automated verification of building
   structures.},

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) system experts often have
   difficulties in converting their designs, in computer-aided design
   (CAD), into building information models (BIMs) owing to excessive
   repetitive work, lack of BIM skilled workers, frequent BIM recreations,
   etc. Therefore, this study aimed to formalize the CAD-to-BIM process of
   MEP systems, focusing on sanitary plumbing system, including soil, drain
   system, hot water supply, and cold water supply system. Each system's
   process is composed of a combination of the following five common
   modules: pipeline processing module, pipe connection module, initial
   level setting module, addition riser nipple module, and clash resolution
   module. Consequently, a prototype developed based on the formalized
   process produced a sanitary plumbing BIM model that is identical to the
   CAD drawings and has no clashes. This study contributes to the MEP BIM
   theory by identifying considerations for CAD-to-BIM conversion of
   sanitary plumbing system and formalizing the process reflecting them.

   years as a result of global environmental concerns. In light of global
   climate change, sustainable development is imperative to consider during
   architectural designs of the buildings and mega infrastructural
   projects. All the nations are developing assembly building tools widely
   to speed up the construction, but the material and design impact a lot,
   while we calculate the environmental factors such as carbon emissions.
   Assembly building component automation system is often used to complete
   components processing and to deliver the best project, which considers
   environmental concerns. The construction processing involves many
   factors such as carbon emission, energy consumption, waste management,
   and solar-based energy generation to make the overall project
   sustainable for energy. Therefore, this paper proposes a BIM-based
   (Building Information Modeling) assembly building component automation
   system targeted at adopting sustainability principles in the
   construction sector, which can consider various factors for maintaining
   eco-friendly environment. The BIM model of the assembled building
   components is designed and tested in a simulated environment. The system
   test result shows that the error rate of component design in this system
   is lower than that of the other two automation systems taken up for the
   comparative study and the proposed process is more stable, faster, and
   eco- friendly. Therefore, the design result of the assembly building
   component automation system based on BIM technology is scientific and
   effective for sustainable development.},

Title = {The role of interoperability dimensions in building information
   modelling},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {129},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a paradigm shift from the
   traditional Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry
   practices to digital construction delivery processes. BIM provides the
   capabilities of cost reduction, increase quality, enhanced productivity,
   and on-time delivery. Despite the numerous advantages of BIM, its
   adoption in AEC is vulnerable to confrontation. Data interoperability is
   often cited as a significant barrier to BIM adoption; there is a limited
   focus on other dimensions of interoperability. In other research areas,
   such as information systems and electronic government, the evolution of
   interoperability construct is debated beyond data interoperability.
   These dimensions of interoperability have yet to be explored in the AEC
   industry. This research article aims to introduce the BIM
   Interoperability Adoption Model (BIAM). For this purpose, we investigate
   the interoperability in multiple dimensions according to the European
   Interoperability framework and develop BIM Inter operability Model with
   factors affecting each interoperability dimension. BIAM offers a
   comprehensive assessment of technical, organizational, semantic, and
   legal interoperability in intra -organizational AEC units,
   inter-organizational AEC, and BIM partner organizations and assists as a
   model in assessing the level of compliance and maturity
   interoperability. BIAM is proposed to work as a link between the
   organizational, semantic, legal, and technical factors to determine the
   interoperability issues in the early stages of BIM adoption. The BIAM
   model addresses interoperability factors and provides recommendations
   and specifications to help AEC firms to collaborate more effectively by
   improving interoperability activities, organizational mapping processes,
   and improving legal coordination. Furthermore, opportunities for future
   research related to BIM interoperability are discussed, and addressing
   these aspects of interoperability will make collaborative project
   delivery well informed, more structured, and effective.

   the Semantic Segmentation for BIM Modeling and Evaluation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},

Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Building Information models created from laser scanning inputs are
   becoming increasingly commonplace, but the automation of the modeling
   and evaluation is still a subject of ongoing research. Current
   advancements mainly target the data interpretation steps, i.e., the
   instance and semantic segmentation by developing advanced deep learning
   models. However, these steps are highly influenced by the
   characteristics of the laser scanning technologies themselves, which
   also impact the reconstruction/evaluation potential. In this work, the
   impact of different data acquisition techniques and technologies on
   these procedures is studied. More specifically, we quantify the capacity
   of static, trolley, backpack, and head-worn mapping solutions and their
   semantic segmentation results such as for BIM modeling and analyses
   procedures. For the analysis, international standards and specifications
   are used wherever possible. From the experiments, the suitability of
   each platform is established, along with the pros and cons of each
   system. Overall, this work provides a much needed update on point cloud
   validation that is needed to further fuel BIM automation.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on calibration and test campaigns of an IoT
   camera-based sensor system to monitor occupancy, as part of an ongoing
   research project aiming at defining a Building Management System (BMS)
   for facility management based on an occupancy-oriented Digital Twin
   (DT). The research project aims to facilitate the optimization of
   building operational stage through advanced monitoring techniques and
   data analytics. The quality of collected data, which are the input for
   analyses and simulations on the DT virtual entity, is critical to ensure
   the quality of the results. Therefore, calibration and test campaigns
   are essential to ensure data quality and efficiency of the IoT sensor
   system. The paper describes the general methodology for the BMS
   definition, and method and results of first stages of the research. The
   preliminary analyses included Indicative Post-Occupancy Evaluations
   (POEs) supported by Building Information Modelling (BIM) to optimize
   sensor system planning. Test campaign are then performed to evaluate
   collected data quality and system efficiency. The method was applied on
   a Department of Politecnico di Milano. The period of the year in which
   tests are performed was critical for lighting conditions. In addition,
   spaces' geometric features and user behavior caused major issues and
   faults in the system.Incorrect boundary definition: areas that are not

Abstract = {This research focuses on the automation of an existing structural health
   monitoring system of a bridge using the BIMification approach. This
   process starts with the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of an existing
   bridge for the numerical calculations of static and dynamic parameters.
   The validation of the FE model and existing SHM system was carried out
   by the field load testing (Static and dynamic) of the bridge. Further,
   this study tries to fill the research gap in the area of automatic FE
   model generation by using a novel methodology that can generate a
   BIM-based FE model using Visual Programming Language (VPL) scripts. This
   script can be exported to any FE software to develop the geometry of the
   FE model. Moreover, the SHM devices are deployed to the Building
   Information modelling (BIM) model of the bridge to generate the
   BIM-based sensory model (as per the existing SHM system). In this way,
   the BIM model is used to manage and monitor the SHM system and control
   its sensory elements. These sensors are then linked with the
   self-generated (Internet of Things) IoT platform (coded in Arduino),
   developing a smart SHM system of the bridge. Resultantly, the system
   features visualisation and remote accessibility to bridge health
   monitoring data.},

Abstract = {PurposeDespite the technological paradigm shift presented to the
   architecture, engineering, construction and operations sector (AECO),
   the full-fledged acceptance of the building information modelling (BIM)
   methodology has been slower than initially anticipated. Indeed, this
   study aims to acknowledge the need for increasing supportive
   technologies enabling the use of BIM, attending to available human
   resources, their requirements and their tasks.
   Design/methodology/approachA complete case study is described, including
   the development process centred on design science research methodology
   followed by the usability assessment procedure validated by construction
   projects facility management operational staff. FindingsResults show
   that participants could interact with BIM using openBIM processes and
   file formats naturally, as most participants reached an efficiency level
   close to that expected for users already familiar with the interface
   (i.e. high-efficiency values). These results are consistent with the
   reported perceived satisfaction and analysis of participants' discourses
   through 62 semi-structured interviews. Originality/valueThe
   contributions of the present study are twofold: a proposal for a virtual
   reality openBIM framework is presented, particularly for the semantic
   enrichment of BIM models, and a methodology for evaluating the usability
   of this type of system in the AECO sector.},

Title = {Facilitating compliance with BIM ISO 19650 naming convention through

Abstract = {Purpose To foster effective implementation of building information
   modelling (BIM), it is guided by standards and protocols that require
   files naming in a format, containing a string of letters and digits in a
   tightly defined manner, which is perceived to be time-consuming,
   error-prone and serves as a barrier to BIM adoption. This paper aims to
   present a BIM-based plug-in solution (Auto-BIMName) that facilitates
   automated naming in compliance with BIM standards.
   Design/methodology/approach The Auto-BIMName portal has an information
   management system (IMS) for generating a master information delivery
   plan (MIDP), which serves as pre-requisites to effective file naming.
   Once the naming schema is implemented through text input controls for a
   project name, volume, level and number, the Revit plugin communicates
   with its IMS to fetch the name string or concatenate the string in line
   with the ISO 19650 convention, where the IMS is unused. The system was
   validated through a simulated collaborative project. Findings System
   testing and evaluation confirmed that the Auto-BIMName will ease the
   process of file naming, thereby facilitating collaboration efficiency,
   naming consistency across project teams and lifecycle stages, ease of
   file naming, time-saving and inducement for BIM implementation, etc. By
   linking information from MIDP in the BIM execution plan, the platform
   enhanced information management processes and improved coordination
   across project teams and lifecycle stages. Originality/value Apart from
   demonstrating how the automated naming platform enhances project
   performance, information management and coordination, the paper provides
   a practical demonstration of how the construction industry will benefit
   from enhanced digitalisation and process automation.},

Title = {Innovating the Construction Life Cycle through BIM/GIS Integration: A
   Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The construction sector is in continuous evolution due to the
   digitalisation and integration into daily activities of the building
   information modelling approach and methods that impact on the overall
   life cycle. This study investigates the topic of BIM/GIS integration
   with the adoption of ontologies and metamodels, providing a critical
   analysis of the existing literature. Ontologies and metamodels share
   several similarities and could be combined for potential solutions to
   address BIM/GIS integration for complex tasks, such as asset management,
   where heterogeneous sources of data are involved. The research adopts a
   systematic literature review (SLR), providing a formal approach to
   retrieve scientific papers from dedicated online databases. The results
   found are then analysed, in order to describe the state of the art and
   suggest future research paths, which is useful for both researchers and
   practitioners. From the SLR, it emerged that several studies address
   ontologies as a promising way to overcome the semantic barriers of the
   BIM/GIS integration. On the other hand, metamodels (and MDE and MDA
   approaches, in general) are rarely found in relation to the integration
   topic. Moreover, the joint application of ontologies and metamodels for
   BIM/GIS applications is an unexplored field. The novelty of this work is
   the proposal of the joint application of ontologies and metamodels to
   perform BIM/GIS integration, for the development of software and systems
   for asset management.},

Title = {Quantifying BIM investment value: a systematic review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 13},
Abstract = {PurposePerceived benefits of building information modelling (BIM) have
   been discussed for some time, but cost-benefit benchmarking has been
   inconsistent. The purpose of this paper is to investigate BIM
   feasibility and evaluate investment worth to elucidate and develop the
   current understanding of BIM merit. The aim of the study is to propose a
   research agenda towards a more holistic perspective of BIM use
   incorporating quantifying investment
   return.Design/methodology/approachAn in-depth examination of research
   patterns has been conducted to identify challenges in the assessment of
   the investment value and return on investment (ROI) for BIM in the
   construction industry. A total of 75 research articles were considered
   for the final literature review. An evaluation of the literature is
   conducted using a combination of bibliometric analysis and systematic
   reviews.FindingsThis study, which analysed 75 articles, unveils key
   findings in quantifying BIM benefits, primarily through ROI calculation.
   Two major research gaps are identified: the absence of a standardized
   BIM ROI method and insufficient exploration of intangible benefits.
   Research focus varies across phases, emphasizing design and construction
   integration and exploring post-construction phases. The study
   categorizes quantifiable factors, including productivity, changes and
   rework reduction, requests for information reduction, schedule
   efficiency, safety, environmental sustainability and operations and
   facility management. These findings offer vital insights for researchers
   and practitioners, enhancing understanding of `BIM's financial benefits
   and signalling areas for further exploration in
   construction.Originality/valueThe `study's outcomes offer the latest
   insights for researchers and practitioners to create effective
   approaches for quantifying `BIM's financial benefits. Additionally, the
   proposed research agenda aims to improve the current limited
   understanding of BIM feasibility and investment worth evaluation.
   Results of the study could assist practitioners in overcoming
   limitations associated with BIM investment and economic evaluations in

Title = {Comparative analysis of drivers to BIM adoption among AEC firms in
   developing countries A case of Nigeria},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {18},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1425-1447},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Building information modelling (BIM) adoption is vital to the
   productivity and competitive nature of the construction sector. However,
   BIM adoptions have not been generally embraced by many architecture,
   engineering and construction (AEC) firms, particularly in developing
   countries. Moreover, studies that investigate the important drivers to
   BIM adoptions among construction professionals through quantitative
   approach are limited. The purpose of this study is to address the
   aforementioned gap.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study involves a literature review, a pilot study and a
   questionnaire survey. The primary data were carried out using structured
   questionnaires distributed to four different BIM adopter AEC firms.
   These comprised architectural firms, facility management firms, quantity
   surveying firms and structural engineering firms in Lagos, Nigeria. Data
   obtained were analysed using mean score, standard deviation,
   Kruskal-Wallis test and factor analysis.
   Findings
   The study identified 23 drivers to BIM adoption, and the relative
   importance of the identified drivers was gauged from each selected BIM
   adopter AEC firm category. The result of the Kruskal-Wallis test showed
   that there is no statistically significant difference in the perceptions
   of the four selected AEC firms in the mean ranking of the identified 23
   drivers to BIM adoption. The findings from factor analysis categorized
   the identified drivers into two major factors to include cost and time
   savings, improved communication, and BIM awareness and government
   supports.
   Originality/value
   The study findings will provide information to policymakers and
   construction stakeholders to make policy recommendations that are
   capable of positively influencing the widespread adoption of BIM in AEC
   firms in particular and the construction industry at large. This study
   is important because the studies that comparatively and empirically
   analyzed BIM drivers in AEC firms are rare, particularly in developing
   countries. Hence, this study could be used to benchmark future studies
   in developing countries.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article focuses on the information modeling of buildings and its
   subsequent extension to the information modeling of cities, which can be
   considered as the main topics of the construction industry development.
   It offers new knowledge for city management, facility management and
   other fields of construction sector. Information modeling of buildings
   and cities creates a suitable basis for the creation of various
   simulations (acoustic, thermal, environmental influence, sunlight or the
   spread of pollution) and analyses. Simulations and results obtained from
   them can help us in the decision-making phase, they predict problems or
   unexpected situations during the life cycle of cities and buildings, and
   thus make it possible to prevent their occurrence. In the second part of
   the contribution, an innovative model, the so-called R-WIM, is
   presented. BIM modeling methods were used for the research and extended
   to the public environment. The expansion of the public environment
   digitization enables to obtain a sufficient amount of information about
   the public space and then subsequently combine them with static weather
   data. This model deals with Urban Water Infrastructure with the focus on
   Rainwater Management and has been developed for the particular needs of
   individual municipalities in the process of solving problem situations
   associated with rainwater, which is very current due to climate change,
   and municipalities require appropriate tools to predict the behavior of
   rainwater so that various compensatory measures can be created.},

Abstract = {This study developed a formwork automation design software that
   interprets 3D building information modeling (BIM) data from the 2D CAD
   data of a target structure. This software aimed to identify the quantity
   and types of formworks and situations that may occur at construction
   sites. A prototype that can implement 3D automation design, automatic
   formwork layout, and statistics function was developed for simple target
   structures; this confirmed the possibility of developing the software,
   for which a preliminary study was conducted to convert random vertices
   in the BIM data of the target structure to forms with certain rules. The
   meshes were transformed into a constant form using an algorithm that
   fills a 3D model with identical square meshes. Additionally, an
   algorithm was developed by setting and prioritizing specific rules for
   the faces. The software operation result confirmed the possibility of
   automatic formwork layout of wall and deck members.},

Abstract = {Traditional project management applications are appeared working
   separately of their participating project teams and isolating the input
   of each team to both geometry and non-geometry of the project. With the
   introduction of Building Information Modelling (BIM), Architectural,
   Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry expected it would be a
   panacea as a tool to effectively collaborate project teams and to
   efficiently share geometry and non-geometry data relevant to not only
   design and construction but also covering the whole life-cycle of the
   project. All these BIM functions are relied on its automation
   capability; in other words, BIM vision totally discourages manual
   processing of data. As a result, good interoperability practice needs to
   pass data automatically between applications of different project teams.
   Many international associations are working in search of full
   interoperability among BIM players of the project; however, the goal is
   yet to succeed. The current study identifies the impact due to poor
   interoperability between applications and takes considerable effort to
   minimise or eliminate if possible. Software Interoperability Matrix
   (SIM) is the proposed solution delivering the outcome. Action research
   is the methodology adopted to develop SIM, in which researchers and
   professionals actively participated. Major industry contribution of SIM
   is to realise interoperability issues between BIM players prior to the
   project and upon identification, precautionary measures can be taken
   introducing new plug-ins or completely switching to new compatible
   application if it is the only solution.},

Abstract = {When using Building Information Modeling (BIM) for complex building
   design, optimizing the building quality in a design phase becomes an
   important part of integrated and advanced building design. The use of
   data from an information model in the design phase allows efficient
   assessment of different design strategies and structural variants and a
   higher quality of the final design. This paper aims to analyze and
   verify possible BIM data-driven workflows for Complex Building Quality
   Assessment (CBQA) and a suitable BIM data structure set up for automatic
   assessment and evaluation. For an efficient automation process in
   complex quality building assessment in the design phase, it is necessary
   first to understand the data structure of the Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC), which is widely accepted and used for buildings, and
   second to understand the data structure of the assessment methodology
   used for the assessment. This article describes possible data workflows
   for an automatic assessment based on the experience gained on a case
   study of the real pilot project of a residential building, where the
   complex building quality was tested using SBToolCZ, the Czech national
   assessment method. This article presents the experience and
   recommendations for setting up the data model of a building for
   automatic assessment.},

Title = {BIM-Based Timber Formwork Design and Modeling},
Journal = {PRACTICE PERIODICAL ON STRUCTURAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is one of the most promising new
   technological developments that can be used to facilitate design and
   construction automation. Prior BIM research has primarily focused on
   permanent building components; temporary structures such as scaffolding
   and concrete formwork have received little attention. The design and
   planning of concrete formwork systems, however, would substantially
   benefit from the capabilities of BIM. Formwork design is repetitive and
   can be very time-consuming due to the need to analyze multiple
   parameters of individual permanent components, the latest formwork
   design guidelines, methods, and procedures, and the available materials.
   In this study, a BIM-based tool is developed and proposed to assist
   designers and builders in planning, designing, and generating concrete
   formwork design models for planning purposes. By integrating the design
   procedures recommended by the American Concrete Institute (ACI), the
   streamlining tool automates the design and modeling process for timber
   concrete formwork through an application programming interface (API) in
   Revit. The workability of the proposed tool was demonstrated through a
   case study. The study also employed the survey method to investigate the
   effectiveness of the proposed tool and its potential for improving
   worker safety and health from the perspectives of formwork
   professionals. Using the tool, form designers and planners will be able
   to determine the most applicable formwork design based on the permanent
   facility structure along with the availability of construction
   materials, site conditions present, and worker safety and health
   considerations. The study also provides contractors with a new tool for
   planning concrete operations and expands the scope of BIM design.},

Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) brings several benefits to design
   and construction companies, especially in higher efficiency and quality
   of work. Several companies also use common data environment (CDE)
   systems, which speed up communication and collaboration between project
   participants. These can be used for occupational health and safety (HS)
   purposes and to increase the level of HS on construction sites. The
   first part of the article presents the state-of-the-art possibilities
   and approaches to implementing BIM in automatic or semi-automatic health
   and safety hazard detection. The following parts analyze the interviews
   with experts in BIM coordination, project management and health and
   safety in Slovakia and their answers to a survey, that covers the topic
   of safety hazard detection in BIM. The analysis shows that BIM is a
   suitable tool for increasing safety on construction sites, but there are
   several obstacles to achieving its full potential. The survey brings
   readers closer to the current state of the topic and the possibilities
   offered by BIM and CDE software in Slovakia. This paper, through the
   requirements and opinions of experts in BIM, project management and HS
   management, points out areas for further research and development of BIM

Abstract = {At present, building information modeling (BIM) has been developed into
   a digital backbone of the architecture, engineering, and construction
   industry. Also, recent decades have witnessed the fast development of
   various AI techniques in reliably tackling a huge amount of data under
   complex and uncertain environments. Since both BIM and artificial
   intelligence (AI) have attracted sustainable attention, the integration
   of BIM and AI can demonstrate newly added value in handling construction
   projects with inherent complexity and uncertainty. For a clear
   understanding of BIM-AI integration in boosting smart construction
   management, the goal of this paper is to make a comprehensive
   investigation and summary of its potential value and practical utility
   to drive the construction industry to catch up with the fast pace of
   automation and digitalization. Through both the bibliometric analysis
   and information analysis, this paper provides a deep insight into the
   status quo and future trends for leveraging AI during the entire
   lifecycle of a BIM-enabled project. It is worth noting that keywords
   that are highly cited in the latest two years contain deep learning,
   internet of things, digital twin, and others, which means AI is evolving
   as the next frontier to accelerate the revolution in the traditional
   civil engineering. According to keyword clusters derived from the
   log-likelihood ratio, we determine six advanced research interests and
   discuss the state-of-the-art research, including automated design and
   rule checking, 3D as-built reconstruction, event log mining, building
   performance analysis, virtual and augmented reality, and digital twin.
   Besides, a growing force can be put on three potential directions to
   more broadly adopt the BIM-AI integration, including synthesis of
   human-machine intelligence, civil-level digital twin, and blockchain,
   aiming to make BIM and AI live up to expectations.},

Title = {Towards 4D BIM: A Systematic Literature Review on Challenges, Strategies
   and Tools in Leveraging AI with BIM},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {In moving toward the fourth dimension of building information modeling
   (4D BIM), this study systematically reviews the literature on
   challenges, strategies, and tools in 4D BIM-related research. To address
   the limitation of the static nature of knowledge represented in
   traditional building information modeling (BIM), 4D BIM incorporates the
   time dimension into BIM systems to anticipate potential delays, optimize
   workflows, and improve overall project efficiency in the architecture,
   engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Although existing BIM
   research has covered various aspects, in-depth review studies
   specifically on 4D BIM remain scarce. Following a systematic search and
   data analysis, this work examines research contexts (building
   information models, lean systems, ontology frameworks, predictive
   strategies, and tools, software and techniques) in 4D BIM research and
   evaluates them qualitatively. The research and evaluation identified
   several key strategies for advancing 4D BIM, including the integration
   of lean methodologies, predictive strategies, and ontology frameworks.
   These approaches contribute to the automation of information sharing and
   the optimization of processes within AEC digital infrastructures. This
   review highlights the gaps in current research and emphasizes the
   importance of integrated digital solutions while also classifying the
   existing tools, software, and standards related to 4D BIM while
   presenting a foundation for future research on AI-driven solutions.},

   the timber frame self-build housing sector},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {BIM, gamification, and Virtual Reality applications are more often used
   to serve the interests of Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA).
   This paper presents a comprehensive study to exploit these technologies'
   innovative approaches and capabilities. The study is specifically
   adopted to implement small and medium-size architectural and
   construction practices with a limited budget and time dedicated to
   visualisation creation. The collected evidence proved that a game-like
   platform combined with BIM could provide simplified data delivery to a
   client, leading to customer satisfaction, confidence and increased
   sales. The designed workflow and templates were tested in the case study
   of a small self-build construction company. The staff was trained to
   provide BIM data correctly and use supplied game templates. The case
   study demonstrated that automation of the VR House Configurator creation
   is achievable. The study's outcome is an integrated solution to
   regenerate BIM models in the game environment and utilise the house
   configurator's organised furniture library and costing interface.
   Furthermore, the usability tests confirmed the applicability,
   practicability, and validity of the devel-oped framework and tools to
   deal with the revealed challenges in the self-build sector. Finally, the
   research provided a fresh approach for the companies in the sector, a
   step-by-step guide for implementing the innovative changes, and detailed
   descriptions of the methodologies and workflows.},

Title = {Prospective Directions in the Computer Systems Industry Foundation
   Classes (IFC) for Shaping Data Exchange in the Sustainability and
   Resilience of Cities},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Sustainability and resilience in addressing construction's
   environmental, social, and economic challenges rely on interoperability.
   A model-centred approach using standardised information structures like
   industry foundation classes (IFC) is essential for data sharing in
   architecture, engineering, construction, and facility management.
   Achieving complete interoperability across domains requires further
   research. This review paper focuses on IFC schema, highlighting upcoming
   developments like IFC 5 and ``IFC x{''}, with a core emphasis on
   modularisation to enhance domain interoperability, improved links
   between building information modelling (BIM) and geographic information
   systems (GIS), along with IoT integration into BIM, cloud-based
   collaboration, and support for other advanced technologies such as
   augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence
   (AI), and digital twins. Through a critical examination of the IFC and
   an outlook towards its future enhancements, the research has the
   potential to offer valuable insights into shaping the trajectory of
   future advancements within the AEC and facility management sectors. The
   study's discoveries could aid in establishing standardised data exchange
   protocols in these industries, promoting uniformity across projects,
   facilitating smoother communication, and mitigating errors and
   inefficiencies. Anticipating enhancements in the IFC could catalyse
   innovation, fostering the adoption of emerging technologies and
   methodologies. Consequently, this could drive the creation of more
   sophisticated tools and procedures, ultimately enhancing project
   outcomes and operational effectiveness.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Research on building information modelling (BIM) for corporate real
   estate management (CREM) in the chemical industry remains limited. This
   is largely due to a lack of documents supporting BIM adoption and
   implementation. The present study identifies, compares, and applies
   different approaches to the definition of asset information requirements
   (AIR) templates for facility services in the chemical industry. It
   subsequently translates the results into recommendations for AIR
   template implementation and formalises them into implementation steps.
   The results indicate that process diagrams are an expedient approach to
   the definition of AIR templates. Recommendations for their
   implementation concern information management software, static data
   prioritisation, accuracy limitations, asset types and sub-types, and
   stakeholder involvement. The present study contributes to the body of
   knowledge by identifying an expedient approach to the definition of AIR
   templates, providing AIR for four BIM Uses, and proposing an AIR
   template implementation framework for CREM in the chemical industry.},

   Monitoring and Maintenance Process: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Improvements in the science of health monitoring and maintenance have
   facilitated the observation of damage and defects in existing structures
   and infrastructures, such as bridges and railways. The need to extend
   sensing technology through the use of wireless sensors as well as the
   lack of description tools for understanding, visualizing, and
   documenting sensor outputs has encouraged researchers to use powerful
   tools such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) systems. BIM has
   become important because of conducting tools widely used in the
   Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to present
   and manage information on structural systems and situations. Since
   combining health monitoring and maintenance results with BIM models is a
   new field of study, and most projects utilize various aspects of it, we
   have conducted a review of important work related to this subject
   published from 2010 to November of 2020. After reviewing 278 journal
   articles, research trends, approaches, methods, gaps, and future agenda
   related to BIM in monitoring and maintenance were highlighted. This
   paper, through a bibliometric and content analysis, concludes that
   besides main improvements, some limitations now exist which affect the
   modeling and maintenance process. These limitations are related to
   extending the IFC schema, optimizing sensor data, interoperability among
   various BIM platforms, optimization of various sensing technologies for
   fault detection and management of huge amounts of data, besides
   consideration of environmental effects on monitoring hazards and
   underground objects. Finally, this paper aims to help to solve the
   mentioned limitation through a comprehensive review of existing
   research.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {106},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Building environmental assessment (BEA) is critical to improving
   sustainability. However, the BEA process is inefficient, costly, and
   often inaccurate. Because automation has the potential to enhance the
   efficiency and accuracy of the BEA process, studies have focused on
   automating BEA (ABEA). Updated until now, a comprehensive analysis of
   prevailing literature on ABEA remains absent. This study conducts the
   first comprehensive systematic analysis appraising the state-of-the-art
   of research on ABEA. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided to systematically analyse 91
   relevant studies. Results uncover that only 29.7\% of BEA systems
   worldwide have automated their processes, with the US LEED residing at
   the vanguard of automation efforts. The New Buildings scheme was mostly
   focused on, while largely ignoring other schemes, e.g., Existing
   Buildings. Five key digital approaches to ABEA were revealed, namely
   building information modelling (BIM) and plug-in software, BIM-ontology,
   data mining and machine learning, cloud-BIM, and digital twin-based
   approaches. Based on identified gaps, future research directions are
   proposed, specifically: using data mining and machine learning models
   for ABEA; development of a holistic cloud-based approach for real-time
   BEA; and digital twin for dynamic BEA. This study generates a deeper
   understanding of ABEA and its theoretical implications, such as major
   constructs and emerging perspectives, constitute a basis for holistic,
   and innovation in, BEA.},

Title = {Urban Heritage Facility Management: A Scoping Review},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This review examines current discussions from the cross-section study
   between urban heritage conservation and urban facility management fields
   in the academic literature from 2011-2020. The purpose is to identify
   the gaps within the examined papers to reveal the challenges and
   opportunities in the combined fields using the United Nations
   Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s
   recommendation of the historic urban landscape (HUL) approach. The
   scoping review procedure was followed. The six critical steps and four
   supporting tools of the HUL approach were used to analyze the examined
   papers. Most aspects of urban heritage management within the body of
   literature were directly related to urban-scale facility management. The
   potential usage of building information modelling became one of the most
   discussed technological aspects. The expansion of the public-private
   partnership model into the public-private-people partnership is
   considered as a new potential business model. At the same time, the
   adaptive reuse approach is deemed to be the most sustainable method of
   managing heritage areas. This scoping review identified the financial
   tools as the most under-researched urban heritage facility management
   component. Therefore, it needs to be endorsed among the scientific
   communities to improve the knowledge and provide operable guidelines for
   the authorities and practitioners in the urban heritage field.},

Title = {Registration of Building Scan with IFC-Based BIM Using the Corner Points},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Progress monitoring is an essential part of large construction projects.
   As manual progress monitoring is time-consuming, the need for automation
   emerges, especially as, nowadays, BIM for the design of buildings and
   laser scanning for capturing the as-built situation have become well
   adopted. However, to be able to compare the as-built model obtained by
   laser scanning to the BIM design, both models need to use the same
   reference system, which often is not the case. Transforming the
   coordinate system of the as-built model into the BIM model is a
   specialist process that is pre-requisite in automated construction
   progress monitoring. The research described in this paper is aimed at
   the automation of this so-called registration process and is based on
   the dominant planar geometry of most buildings with evident corner
   points in their structures. After extracting these corner points from
   both the as-built and the design model, a RANSAC-based pairwise
   assessment of the points is performed to identify potential matching
   points in both models using different discriminative geometric
   invariants. Next, the transformation for the potential matches is
   evaluated to find all the matching points. In the end, the most accurate
   transformation parameter is determined from the individual
   transformation parameters of all the matching corner points. The
   proposed method was tested and validated with a range of both simulated
   and real-life datasets. In all the case studies including the simulated
   and real-life datasets, the registration was successful and accurate.
   Furthermore, the method allows for the registration of the as-built
   models of incomplete buildings, which is essential for effective
   construction progress monitoring. As the method uses the standard IFC
   schema for data exchange with the BIM, there is no loss of geometrical
   information caused by data conversions and it supports the complete
   automation of the progress-monitoring process.},

Title = {Human Perception and Building Automation Systems},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building automation is concerned with closed- and open-loop control of
   building services such as heating, cooling, ventilation and air
   conditioning, lighting and shading. The ultimate goal is to reduce
   energy consumption while providing comfort for the occupants. However,
   ensuring human comfort is a complex affair. In case of dissatisfaction,
   users need to inform the building operators about apparently badly
   adjusted setpoints. Then, service units of the facility management have
   to manually analyze how to improve the situation. Due to the complex
   characteristics of human perception and derived feedback, this can
   become a troublesome and time-consuming task. This paper describes the
   main results of our investigations to improve occupant comfort in office
   buildings using environmental information monitored by a Wireless Sensor
   Network (WSN) and human perception collected from a feedback tool. A
   joint information base aligned with static data from building
   information modeling integrates the information gathered. Reasoning on
   these data sources allows adjustments of the Building Automation System
   (BAS) to automatically enhance the tenant's comfort or suggest necessary
   adjustments for facility managers. Communication between the different
   system components is handled via Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
   (MQTT). A real-world field study shows the potential of the developed
   approach, proves its feasibility, and demonstrates the functionality of
   the feedback tool.},

Abstract = {In construction automation, robotic solution is becoming an emerging
   technology with the advent of artificial intelligence and advancement in
   mechatronic systems. In construction buildings, regular inspections are
   carried out to ensure project completion as per approved plans and
   quality standards. Currently, expert human inspectors are deployed
   onsite to perform inspection tasks with the naked eye and conventional
   tools. This process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, dangerous, and
   repetitive and may yield subjective results. In this article, we propose
   a robotic system equipped with perception sensors and intelligent
   algorithms to help construction supervisors remotely identify the
   construction materials, detect component installations and defects, and
   generate report of their status and location information. The building
   information model (BIM) is used for mobile robot navigation and to
   retrieve building component's location information. Unlike the current
   deep learning-based object detection, which depends heavily on training
   data, this article proposes a data and information-driven approach,
   which incorporates offline training data, sensor data, and BIM
   information to achieve BIM-based object coverage navigation, BIM-based
   false detection filtering, and a fine maneuver technique to improve on
   object detections during real-time automated task execution by robots.
   This allows the user to select building components to be inspected, and
   the mobile robot navigates autonomously to the target components using
   the BIM-generated navigation map. An object detector then detects the
   building components and materials and generates an inspection report.
   The proposed system is verified through laboratory and onsite
   experiments.},

Title = {BIM Use to Support the Technical Tasks in Construction Projects: A Case
   Study},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {BIM use has proved to be inevitable in construction project phases,
   starting from the project initiation phase and ending with the project
   closeout phase. Through the use of 4D/5D/6D models in processes of the
   construction project such as scheduling, bills of quantities (BoQs), and
   environmental analysis, BIM provides massive assistance to all project
   participants. In addition, BIM has been utilized in facility management
   through the use of 7D models. These well-established benefits positively
   impact construction project variables: cost, time, and quality. Despite
   these invaluable contributions in construction projects, BIM is not
   extensively applied in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) of Arab
   countries, especially in small/medium-scale construction projects. BIM
   use at these project scales is mainly exclusive to the design phases.
   The present use of BIM in GCC construction projects leads to the missing
   of numerous opportunities, which negatively affects project delivery
   methods, project timelines, and, consequently, project budgets. To shed
   more light on this subject, this research paper attempts to answer
   emerging questions, such as the following: How do BIM and other software
   programs support the technical team of construction projects? Do these
   software programs have a direct impact on construction project
   management, in terms of project timelines and work changes? Does BIM add
   unnecessary cost to the project budget? This research paper proposes
   four technical task groups used in construction project phases to
   evaluate the use of BIM and the associated software programs, namely
   technical work, Time and Accuracy, budget, and BoQ. These four task
   groups, moreover, have been ratified and are the subject of consensus by
   project managers and senior engineers in GCC construction projects, who
   provided the research primary data through interviews and field surveys.
   Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to investigate and
   analyze the present status of BIM use in construction projects, and
   subsequently, to establish a basis to propose improvements to support
   the technical team of construction projects. Two approaches are proposed
   to overcome the obstacles that hinder BIM adoption in GCC countries. The
   first one is a top-down approach, in which BIM use and BIM documents are
   mandatory in construction projects. The second approach is a bottom-up
   approach, where having more BIM professionals in the GCC market will
   facilitate the transformation to BIM.},

Title = {Constructing Invariant Signatures for AEC Objects to Support BIM-Based
   Analysis Automation through Object Classification},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) object classification is a key step
   in supporting the full automation of architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) domain tasks such as cost estimation and building
   code compliance checking. A machine learning approach is designated to
   address any classification task without requiring the domain knowledge
   to be explicitly or manually specified in detail. The success of machine
   learning, however, relies on the quality and suitability of input
   features. In order to support seamless interoperability of BIM
   applications, the authors have proposed invariant signatures that
   uniquely define each AEC object and capture their intrinsic properties.
   In this paper, the authors combine the use of invariant signatures
   together with machine learning approach to address BIM object
   classification. The developed invariant signatures include geometric
   signatures, locational signatures, and metadata signatures. To test the
   robustness of their use as machine learning features, the authors
   created a new BIM object data set with 1,900 AEC objects in five major
   categories of building elements, including beams, columns, footings,
   slabs, and walls. The data were manually annotated by independent
   annotators to ensure the quality. Among those AEC objects in the data
   set, 1,330 objects (70\% of the data) were used as training/development
   data and 570 objects (30\% of the data) were used as testing data. The
   authors extracted the predefined invariant signatures as features and
   tested the robustness of them in AEC object classification using
   different machine learning algorithms. The best-performing algorithm
   achieved 99.6\% F1-measure in the testing data, which outperformed the
   state of the art (94.9\% F1-measure). As a demonstration of the value of
   such object classification, a comparative experiment was conducted to
   take off quantities of walls from a student apartment complex, both
   using the state-of-the-art commercial software and using the object
   classification-based automation. Consistent results were found between
   these two quantity takeoff methods, whereas using object
   classification-based automation further saved time and manual efforts
   significantly (saved 98.1\% of the loading and object selecting time).
   These results showed that the use of proposed invariant signatures and
   machine learning algorithms in BIM applications is promising. (C) 2022

Abstract = {The application of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies faces
   many challenges, especially in developing countries. This problem was
   investigated in the existing literature and via a designed questionnaire
   among local practitioners. The reasons were mainly attributed to the
   seclusion of the EIA process across the project's phases, as well as the
   complexity of the EIA procedures. Hence, the research argues that
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) applications can be the key to
   resolve several associated problems to EIA either directly, or
   indirectly by streamlining Environmental Management System (EMS). Thus,
   a keyword-based scientometric analysis was used to define parameters and
   interrelations and establish network analysis for a proposed BIM-based
   EIA framework. The proposed framework presents scoring schemes to
   support three types of assessments: the efficiency of applying BIM
   techniques for an EIA process (Score A), proper integration of BIM
   techniques for different EIA steps (Score I) and proper integration of
   BIM techniques across project phases (Score B). It also shows the
   interplay of points between the three schemes via a Sankey diagram. The
   proposed framework was applied to compare three major construction
   projects in a developing country, the case of Egypt to pinpoint areas of
   drawbacks. The results pinpointed poor application of advanced BIM
   models to support sustainability analysis for EIA studies. This is in
   addition to imbalance of applying BIM applications across different
   project phases, it was notably less pronounced for the operation and
   maintenance stage as well as end of life scenarios. Also, poor
   integration of BIM tools could not support decisions related to the
   mitigation step. Hence, applying 6-dimensional BIM model shall enable
   developing mitigation measures and shall support design optimization
   during building operation and end of life phase. This novel approach
   presents the required level of verification and quality control
   procedure needed by decision-makers and environmental engineers to
   perform EIA studies and pave the way for further related research.

Title = {Digital twins for smart building at the facility management stage: a

Abstract = {Purpose-Despite the opportunities of digital twins (DTs) for smart
   buildings, limited research has been conducted regarding the facility
   management stage, and this is explained by the high complexity of
   accurately representing and modelling the physics behind the DTs
   process. This study thus organises and consolidates the fragmented
   literature on DTs implementation for smart buildings at the facility
   management stage by exploring the enablers, applications and challenges
   and examining the interrelationships amongst them.
   Design/methodology/approach-A systematic literature review approach is
   adopted to analyse and synthesise the existing literature relating to
   the subject topic. Findings-The study revealed six main categories of
   enablers of DTs for smart building at the facility management stage,
   namely perception technologies, network technologies, storage
   technologies, application technologies, knowledge-building and design
   processes. Three substantial categories of DTs application for smart
   buildings were revealed at the facility management stage: efficient
   operation and service monitoring, efficient building energy management
   and effective smart building maintenance. Subsequently, the top four
   major challenges were identified as being ``lack of a systematic and
   comprehensive reference model{''}, ``real-time data integration{''},
   ``the complexity and uncertainty nature of real-time data{''} and
   ``real-time data visualisation{''}. An integrative framework is finally
   proposed by examining the interactive relationship amongst the enablers,
   the applications and the challenges. Practical implications-The findings
   could guide facility managers/engineers to fairly understand the
   enablers, applications and challenges when DTs are being implemented to
   improve smart building performance and achieve user satisfaction at the
   facility management stage. Originality/value-This study contributes to
   the knowledge body on DTs by extending the scope of the existing studies
   to identify the enablers and applications of DTs for smart buildings at
   the facility management stage and the specific challenges.},

Abstract = {The delay in the physical progress of construction creates additional
   costs, missed deadlines, and quality issues. The research aimed to
   estimate the physical progress of the project by using unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs) and building information modeling (BIM). The methodology
   comprised capturing 848 high-resolution images of the Civil Engineering
   Laboratory construction site at the National University of Jaen,
   Cajamarca, Peru, using the Phantom 4 RTK drone. The photographs were
   processed using Agisoft 2.0.1 software, resulting in a point cloud. This
   was then imported into ReCap Pro 2023 software, which was used to assess
   the quality of the points. The Revit 2023 software was subsequently
   utilized to establish the phase parameters, linking the BIM model with
   the point cloud, filtering the model, and eventually exporting it to the
   Power BI 2023 software. The work's estimated progress utilizing the
   proposed methodology was 42.82\%, which was not statistically
   significant compared to the Public Works Information System (INFOBRAS)
   of 43.14\%. This allows for the automation of customary processes, the
   identification of crucial issues, and prompt decision-making. The
   study's originality lies in the suggestion of integrating aerial imagery
   with drones and BIM modeling for the real-time and precise estimation of
   work progression. This method provides a precise and effective
   substitute for traditional techniques for gauging the tangible
   advancement of projects.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of
   an end-to-end simplified and automated reconstruction pipeline for
   digital building assets using the design science research approach.
   Current methods to create digital assets by capturing the state of
   existing buildings can provide high accuracy but are time-consuming,
   expensive and difficult. Design/methodology/approach Using design
   science research, this research identifies the need for a crowdsourced
   and cloud-based approach to reconstruct digital building assets. The
   research then develops and tests a fully functional smartphone
   application prototype. The proposed end-to-end smartphone workflow
   begins with data capture and ends with user applications. Findings The
   resulting implementation can achieve a realistic three-dimensional (3D)
   model characterized by different typologies, minimal trade-off in
   accuracy and low processing costs. By crowdsourcing the images, the
   proposed approach can reduce costs for asset reconstruction by an
   estimated 93\% compared to manual modeling and 80\% compared to locally
   processed reconstruction algorithms. Practical implications The
   resulting implementation achieves ``good enough{''} reconstruction of
   as-is 3D models with minimal tradeoffs in accuracy compared to automated
   approaches and 15x cost savings compared to a manual approach. Potential
   facility management use cases include the issue and information
   tracking, 3D mark-up and multi-model configurators. Originality/value
   Through user engagement, development, testing and validation, this work
   demonstrates the feasibility and impact of a novel crowdsourced and
   cloud-based approach for the reconstruction of digital building assets.},

Abstract = {Facility management (FM) requires multidisciplinary activities, and thus
   has extensive information requirements. Much of that information is
   created during the design, construction, and commissioning phases of a
   project. Providing the owner of a facility with usable life cycle asset
   information after construction has been a challenge to the industry.
   Traditional methods of manually inputting data into FM systems are time
   consuming and error prone. Various automated approaches and workflows
   continue to be developed to respond to specific owner needs. This
   research developed a unique workflow that uses Dynamo within Revit to
   automatically extract asset management data from the model and export
   the data to a proprietary format required by the facility owner. The
   formatted spreadsheet allows for direct linking of the data to the
   owner's FM system, hence eliminating time wasted in manual data entry
   and avoiding missing any maintenance cycles that would result if the FM
   system is not populated with critical information in a timely manner.
   This article utilizes a case study approach to demonstrate this novel
   Dynamo workflow. The required case study asset data identified and
   captured include asset groups, their properties and attributes, and
   corresponding metadata. A basic three-dimensional representation of the
   facility and all its equipment are modeled in Revit and asset data are
   input to corresponding model elements. This article also describes the
   complexity of the owner's proprietary information needs and the
   resulting automated workflow that extracts and exports data from Revit
   into an Excel format that can directly link into the FM system.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Pages = {1306-1324},

Abstract = {Purpose Master information delivery plan (MIDP) is a key requirement for
   building information modelling (BIM) execution plan (BEP) that enlists
   all information deliverables in BIM-based project, containing
   information about what would be prepared, when, by who, as well as the
   procedures and protocols to be used. In a well-conceived BEP, the MIDP
   facilitates collaboration among stakeholders. However, current
   approaches to generating MIDP are manual, making it tedious, error-prone
   and inconsistent, thereby limiting some expected benefits of BIM
   implementation. The purpose of this study is to automate the MIDP and
   demonstrate a collaborative BIM system that overcomes the problems
   associated with the traditional approach. Design/methodology/approach A
   BIM cloud-based system (named Auto-BIMApp) involving naming that
   automated MIDP generation is presented. A participatory action research
   methodology involving academia and industry stakeholders is followed to
   design and validate the Auto-BIMApp. Findings A mixed-method experiment
   is conducted to compare the proposed automated generation of MIDP using
   Auto-BIMApp with the traditional practice of using spreadsheets. The
   quantitative results show over 500\% increased work efficiency, with
   improved and error-free collaboration among team members through
   Auto-BIMApp. Moreover, the responses from the participants using
   Auto-BIMApp during the experiment shows positive feedback in term of
   ease of use and automated functionalities of the Auto-BIMApp.
   Originality/value The replacement of traditional practices to a complete
   automated collaborative system for the generation of MIDP, with
   substantial productivity improvement, brings novelty to the present
   research. The Auto-BIMApp involve multidimensional information, multiple
   platforms, multiple types and levels of users, and generates three
   different representations of MIDP.},

Abstract = {The integration of 3D laser scanning and digital photogrammetry in the
   architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has
   facilitated high-quality architectural surveys. However, the processes
   remains constrained by significant costs, extensive manual labor, and
   accuracy issues associated with manual data processing. This article
   addresses these operational challenges by introducing automated Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) techniques that minimize manual input through
   the use of Dynamo for Autodesk Revit. We developed algorithms that
   efficiently convert point cloud data into accurate BIM models, enhancing
   productivity and reducing the potential for errors. The application of
   these algorithms is analyzed in a case study of the Old Lifeguard
   Station of Fuseta, showcasing notable reductions in modeling time and
   improvements in accuracy. The findings suggest that automated
   scan-to-BIM methods could provide a viable solution for enhancing BIM
   workflows across the industry, with the potential for wider adoption
   given their impact on efficiency and model quality.},

Abstract = {The durability of concrete structures is essential for reliable
   infrastructure. Although many deterioration models are available, they
   are rarely applied in situ. For existing structures in need of repair or
   durability assessment, this is also the case for Building Information
   Modeling (BIM). However, both BIM and durability modeling hold great
   potential to both minimize expended resources and maximize the
   reliability of structures. At the Institute for Building Materials
   Research (ibac) at RWTH Aachen University, a novel approach to the
   calibration of deterioration models using Bayesian inference iteratively
   in a BIM model enriched with machine-readable diagnosis data to achieve
   a predictive decision support tool is being developed. This paper
   demonstrates the digital workflow, validates the proposed approach, and
   expresses the added value for the planning of repair measures.},

Title = {Key information requirements for integrating building information
   modelling with operations and maintenance: A Delphi approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {98},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) with Operations
   \& Maintenance (O\&M) offers great potential for optimising asset
   operational performance. To achieve this, identification of the right
   level of detail of the information requirements is essential. However,
   within the academic literature, it is unclear what information
   requirements (IRs) are needed to aid such integration. This research
   ascertains the key IRs to support BIM and O\&M integration. Through a
   systematic literature review, expert verification, a two-round Delphi,
   and voting analytic hierarchy process (VAHP), this research identifies
   and prioritises 21 distinct IRs based on data obtained from 21 experts.
   The 21 proposed IRs were clustered into five categories namely, general,
   strategic, operational, commercial, and continuous improvement. The
   results show that the topmost important IRs include equipment/asset
   details, building details, historical maintenance records, risk
   assessment, and manufacturer and warranty details. Regarding the
   categorisation of IRs, the general and operational categories emerged as
   the most important categories. The prioritisation of the IRs will
   empower construction stakeholders to enhance the technical knowledge of
   operational performance, improve the current BIM data requirements and
   increase operational efficiency through effective resource allocations.},

Abstract = {The integration of building information model (BIM) with point cloud
   from 3-D laser scanner provides powerful assistance in a variety of
   applications in the life cycle of building. However, the adoption of BIM
   and 3-D laser scanning for applications in the whole life cycle of
   buildings has yet to be satisfactorily reviewed. There is a need to
   understand the current situation of applications with BIM and 3-D laser
   scanning and their combined methods. The authors summarized combined
   methods of BIM and 3-D laser scanning at first. Then. the work presented
   in this article provides summarization of applications in the life cycle
   of building. In addition, the impact of emerging technologies on
   applications also be discussed. In this review, articles were limited to
   those published over the last decade. Two patterns in the approach to
   integrate BIM and 3-D laser scanning are reviewed. Several domains of
   application namely construction progress tracking, building components
   quality control, construction site safety, structural health monitoring,
   rescue after the disaster, energy modeling and management and modeling
   for exist building are looked back. According to occurred time of these
   applications, this article divides them into two classes: applications
   in construction period and applications in maintenance period. Based on
   the observed limitations in the reviewed papers, the authors conclude
   some potential future research trend for these applications based
   emerging technology at the same time.},

Title = {CloudFAS: Cloud-based building fire alarm system using Building
   Information Modelling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Building fires are a common urban disaster. The emergence of high-rise,
   large-scale and inner-complex buildings bring new challenges for fire
   safety and triggers new demand to upgrade traditional building fire
   alarm system (FAS). Different from current studies by deploying
   enor-mous smart fire sensors to replace FAS, this study addresses this
   issue from a novel perspective and proposes a cloud-based FAS using
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) on top of FAS, termed CloudFAS.
   Firstly, the system framework and the software architecture are
   designed. Secondly, two key technologies are presented to address two
   unresolved technical issues: private fire alarm data sharing and
   alignment of fire sensors with the BIM model. A cloud gateway for fire
   sensors is developed to address the first problem by capturing the fire
   alarm data from the fire alarm control unit through the IEEE 1824
   standard. Noticing that the fire sensor locations are listed in a sensor
   installation spreadsheet using natural language, termed as sensor
   location table (SLT). A natural language processing (NLP)-based
   sensor-BIM alignment algorithm is proposed to automatically match fire
   sensors with the BIM model through SLT, which enables to display fire
   sensor statuses in proper places in the 3D BIM model. Finally, a
   concrete case study from the China Construction Library is presented,
   which verifies the effectiveness of our proposed CloudFAS. Our CloudFAS
   is built on top of traditional FAS. If the fire alarm control unit
   follows the IEEE 1824 standard and an SLT is available, then CloudFAS
   can upgrade the traditional FAS in existing buildings effortlessly with
   its BIM model. Moreover, the cloud gateway for fire sensors contributes
   to addressing the private data sharing problem using IEEE 1824 standard,
   and the NLP-based sensor-BIM alignment algorithm can promote the
   adoption of BIM in the building operation phase.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The rapid evolution of digital technologies has revolutionized the
   architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, driving the
   wide-spread adoption of digital twins for structures. These virtual
   replicas, developed using Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   methodology, incorporate extensive information databases, proving
   indispensable for enhancing project management throughout a structure's
   entire lifecycle and towards smart city development. As the impact of
   climate change continues to grow, hazardous weather alerts play a
   critical role as an early-warning system that notifies stakeholders of
   imminent threats, thereby influencing decision-making processes in
   construction projects. Surprisingly, despite its evident value, the
   integration of alert systems for hazardous weather conditions into BIM
   is often overlooked. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Robot Process
   Automation (RPA) protocols to automate the integration of real-time
   weather parameters into a structure's BIM models. These very protocols
   are also used as alert systems, enabling the timely notification of
   stakeholders in the event of detected hazardous weather conditions. The
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through its
   practical application in enhancing the safety of an actual building in
   Vi \& ntilde;a del Mar, Chile.},

Abstract = {Automated construction progress monitoring is the prevalent domain
   amongst researchers, with much potential for improving digital
   monitoring technologies and related processes. Effective, efficient, and
   timely collection of progress data are essential requirements for the
   success of the construction project. This study investigated and
   assessed the achievement level of automation attained in construction
   progress monitoring practices via digital data collection technologies
   for building construction projects. A mixed review methodology
   (bibliometric analysis and systematic review) was adopted, and a total

   articles. Bibliometric analyses were performed considering descriptive
   statistics, and bibliometric mapping for keywords and monitoring
   techniques. This study exemplified the framework for the overall
   conception of the automated construction progress monitoring process,
   utilising close-range data acquisition and detection technologies. These
   technologies under construction progress monitoring were analysed for
   their applications, implementation strategies on building construction
   projects, and BIM-integrated monitoring. This study also highlighted the
   current technical challenges, gaps and future opportunities for the

Abstract = {Traditional manual and semi-automatic approaches rely heavily on
   surveying control points and manually picking equivalent point pairs,
   which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper proposes an
   automatic algorithm for automatic global BIM-point registration and
   association to support construction progress monitoring. A
   representation using distance fields is proposed to efficiently
   integrate BIM in registration tasks. By leveraging a coarse-to-fine
   strategy, a primitive-level coarse algorithm is developed to achieve
   rough alignment between BIM and point cloud. This approach is then
   complemented by a point-level fine registration approach, which enables
   simultaneous pose refinement and BIM-point association. Extensive
   experiments are conducted on the data from simulation and real-world
   construction sites. The results demonstrate the promising registration
   and association performance of the proposed algorithm.},

Title = {BIM for mining - Automated generation of information models using a
   parametric modelling concept},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {186},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in construction has
   greatly improved project delivery, collaboration, and automation.
   However, its application in mining remains underdeveloped due to the
   unique challenges of mining projects, such as their vast scale,
   complexity, and heterogeneity. The present study aims to explore the
   characteristics and potential for adoption of BIM technology in the
   mining sector and focuses on the generation of a Mine Information Model
   (MIM) from raw mine data, addressing a critical gap in the current state
   of digital transformation in the mining industry. We designed a fully
   automated workflow employing parametric modelling to generate models of
   as-excavated underground tunnels and geological block models for mining,
   utilising analytical data from surrounding rock formations. Two case
   studies utilising real mine tunnel data from Finland were conducted to
   validate the proposed automated MIM generation workflow. The input raw
   data includes reality-captured raw data, such as point clouds or mesh
   models of tunnels, borehole information, and associated design files.
   Through the application of topology-based parametric objects and
   script-driven rules, MIMs can be effectively created for mining
   operations. This research offers significant potential for advancing the
   Mine Building Information Modelling (MineBIM) concept, supporting
   machine control, automation, and digital twin applications. As BIM
   adoption grows, innovative solutions are expected to improve efficiency,
   safety, and sustainability in mining. Our code for automating MineBIM
   modelling is available at: https://github.com/zxy23 9/MineBIM.},

Journal = {STRUCTURES},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The trend in systemization and automation of the design process in the
   architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is relatively
   slow because of the diversity of partners, the specificity of each
   project and the iterative nature of the design. Cold-formed steel
   structures which are widely used as a construction system, lends itself
   well to industrialisation. Taking advantage of the building information
   modelling (BIM) features, this paper, develop an optimization procedure
   to help automatizing the interface between the architecture and the
   structural design of this type of framing. The concept relies on using a
   genetic algorithm to generate optimized shear wall panels (SWP) layouts
   at each level of an early architectural IFC model of a multi-storey CFS
   building in BIM environment. The generated layouts fulfil the load
   bearing continuity through the building height and are in compliance
   with main earthquake resisting structural criteria as per codes of
   practice. The performance and the robustness of the algorithm were
   demonstrated using different CFS prototype buildings. The procedure
   achieved very promising results and more importantly, the algorithm can
   accommodate more structural code-based criteria or constructional
   provisions as constraints or as controlling parameters of the
   multi-objective function. In practice, the proposed technique can be
   easily developed and implemented in a BIM platform to assist both the
   architect and the engineer to design optimized CFS buildings to resist
   earthquake loading.},

Abstract = {The emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) has revolutionized
   the infrastructure construction industry by introducing real-time and
   collaborative information management tools to be used throughout the
   lifecycle of projects. The importance of BIM in this industry has been
   emphasized in previous research. However, strategies for the
   implementation of this system is still less explored, which requires
   more elaboration and validation. The purpose of this paper is to
   investigate such strategies considering all necessary dimensions of the
   BIM system in infrastructure construction projects. The findings are
   based on theoretical discussion and semi-structured interviews in a case
   study project in New South Wales, Australia. The results revealed that
   BIM integrates various elements of infrastructure construction, which
   include but are not limited to risk, time, cost, energy, safety, and
   sustainability. It was found that implementation strategies should focus
   on improving the contribution of the BIM system to infrastructure
   construction in terms of improved (1) integrity and automation, (2)
   collaboration, and (3) optimization Identification of seven technical
   and managerial implementations strategies is the core contribution of
   this research. These strategies provide practitioners with insight into
   technical and managerial measures to be taken for the successful
   implementation of the BIM system.},

Title = {Scan-to-BIM-to-Sim: Automated reconstruction of digital and simulation
   models from point clouds with applications on bridges},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The automation of 3D geometric model reconstruction from point clouds is
   essential for efficient management of critical infrastructure assets
   like bridges, significantly streamlining and enhancing inspection and
   structural analysis tasks. However, existing automated frameworks
   frequently encounter challenges due to substantial computational demands
   and the difficulties when applied to defective point clouds, which arise
   from adverse environmental conditions, measurement errors, and
   limitations of surveying equipment. Major limitations also exist in
   achieving real-time data exchange and mapping between Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) models and simulation (Sim) models. To
   address this gap, this paper proposes a comprehensive Scan-to-BIM-to-Sim
   framework that efficiently reconstructs bridge BIM models from imperfect
   point clouds and supports bidirectional mapping between BIM and
   numerical simulations. The method proposes an improved edge detection
   for contour extraction from imperfect point cloud and parametric
   modelling for the direct generation of 3D models within BIM software.
   Additionally, it automates the exchange between BIM models and
   simulation software, facilitating bidirectional operation for real-time
   analysis and visualisation. The framework, validated using the Arial
   Aqueduct Bridge case, reduces modelling time and computational demands,
   thereby streamlining construction simulations with improved accuracy and
   cost efficiency. The dataset collected for model generation and
   validation is openly available at https://doi.org/10.17632/znxxsgn2ky.1.},

Abstract = {Over recent years, the independent adoption of lean construction and
   building information modeling (BIM) has shown improvements in
   construction industry efficiency. Because these approaches have
   overlapping concepts, it is thought that their synergistic adoption can
   bring many more benefits. Today, implementing the lean-BIM theoretical
   framework is still challenging for many companies. This paper conducts a
   comprehensive review with the intent to identify prevailing
   interconnected lean and BIM areas. To this end, 77 papers published in
   AEC journals and conferences over the last decade were reviewed. The
   proposed weighting matrix showed the most promising interactions, namely
   those related to 4D BIM-based visualization of construction schedules
   produced and updated by last planners. The authors also show evidence of
   the lack of a sufficiently integrated BIM-Last Planner System(R)
   framework and technologies. Thus, we propose a new theoretical framework
   considering all BIM and LPS interactions. In our model, we suggest
   automating the generation of phase schedule using joint BIM data and a
   work breakdown structure database. Thereafter, the lookahead planning
   and weekly work plan is supported by a field application that must be
   able to exchange data with the enterprise resource planning system,
   document management systems, and report progress to the BIM model.},

Abstract = {The use of building information modelling (BIM) in construction projects
   is expanding, and its usability throughout building lifecycles, from
   planning and construction to operation and maintenance, is gaining
   increasing proof. In the design of domestic drinking-water and sewerage
   systems (DDWSSs), BIM focuses on coordinating disciplines and their
   design. Despite studies promoting BIM environments for DDWSSs that take
   into account the regulatory frameworks of corresponding countries, these
   efforts do not include the use of parametric tools that enhance the
   efficiency of the design process. Therefore, engineers still use
   conventional 2D design, which requires many rounds of iteration, and
   manual work is also generally still used. In this research, we developed
   and validated an intuitive methodology for solving a specific DDWSS
   problem, using a design science research method (DSRM) as an applied
   science approach. This was addressed by developing an artefact and
   validating it through two case studies. The obtained solution combines
   BIM models and parametric tools to automate the manual activities of the
   traditional design method. This article aims to bring abstract BIM
   concepts into practice and encourage researchers and engineers to adopt
   BIM for DDWSSs.},

Title = {Key requirements for effective implementation of building information
   modelling for maintenance management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1902-1910},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {BIM is broadly useful in the construction industry, and it is a
   significant tool in maintenance management, yet it is regularly
   misinterpreted and not used adequately. Maintenance management is the
   complete administration of all amenities that supports the fundamental
   operations or uses of a building or facility. This study aims to
   evaluate the key requirements for the effective implementation of
   Building Information Modelling. A quantitative research method was
   adopted to achieve the aim of the study using a questionnaire survey. A
   total of one hundred and twenty-six questionnaires were retrieved from
   respondents in the Gauteng province of South Africa. The respondents
   include facility managers, construction managers, quantity surveyors,
   architects, and engineers. Retrieved data were analyzed using
   descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings from the study revealed
   that training of construction management staff; increased awareness of
   BIM; and full support from the owner are the key requirements while
   factor analysis clustered the requirements into three groups, namely top
   management commitment; awareness and training; and organizational
   technical capabilities. The study concluded that a huge responsibility
   is placed on the top management of an organization to promote the
   adoption of BIM for the maintenance management of infrastructure in the
   construction industry. The findings of the study are valuable to
   facility managers and facility stakeholders as it gives an insight into
   the implementation of BIM in the sector, which few studies have
   addressed since the advent of BIM globally.},

Title = {BIM-BVBS integration with openBIM standards for automatic prefabrication
   of steel reinforcement},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {125},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Processing steel reinforcement is an on-site activity that includes
   cutting and bending, which are time-consuming and uneconomical. When
   moving toward the construction automation, off-site prefabrication is
   important with the aid of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) which are utilized as a collaborative
   approach to facilitate the fabrication workflow and data
   interoperability. This paper presents the integration of BIM and steel
   fabrication machine codes (BVBS) with openBIM standards to interoperate
   the computerized design and prefabrication automation of steel
   reinforcement. The integration begins with the reference of Information
   Delivery Manual (IDM) which involves the identification of information
   requirement in the process map for identifying the necessary data
   exchange within the prefabrication process. Definition of IFC model
   views is conducted to ensure that the exchange of data meets the end
   user?s needs and is implementable for software applications. Next, the
   process information model of steel reinforcement fabrication is
   established by connecting the IFC entities with relationships among the
   specific tasks. A new approach is developed to extend the IFC data
   schema with prefab-related entities. The proposed BIM-BVBS integration
   is demonstrated utilizing IFC viewers and visual programming tools
   (Dynamo) in illustrative examples, the results of which reveal that
   prefab-related entities and attributes in IFC-based BIM models can be
   extracted efficiently to cater to the BVBS data transformation toward
   automatic prefabrication.},

Abstract = {The present study introduces a framework for integrating building
   information modelling (BIM) to building energy modelling (BEM) using
   labelled property graphs (LPG) and the Modelica simulation environment.
   The proposed methodology leverages graphs to effectively represent space
   boundary topology information. Graphs excel at modelling relationships,
   enabling efficient queries, intuitive visualizations and easier error
   detection in BIM models. Graph-based operations are applied to adapt the
   model for energy modelling. Additional steps including IFC validation,
   active systems and building operation parameters parsing, zoning
   process, and Modelica dynamic energy model generation are thoroughly
   discussed, providing valuable insights. Performance-wise, the framework
   showed promising results, achieving acceptable parsing times of only a
   few seconds. A case study of a multistory building in France
   demonstrated the framework's effectiveness and functionality. The
   methodology streamlines the traditionally complex BIM-to-BEM workflow,
   ensuring robust data mapping and accurate energy simulations, and
   offering practical guidelines for future applications.},

Title = {Platform-independent visual installation progress monitoring for
   construction automation},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {154},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Efficient interior progress monitoring is crucial for the timely
   completion of construction projects. Although robots have been used for
   data acquisition to automate interior progress monitoring, existing
   methods do not adequately consider the variations of robot platforms and
   different types of construction environments, which makes it challenging
   to apply these methods to various robots and environments. This paper
   proposes an integrated system that achieves automated interior
   installation progress monitoring, which can be applied to various
   construction environments and robot platforms. Algorithms are proposed
   to systematically generate navigation goal points for robot navigations
   based on BIM information of objects, which enables the detection of
   target objects with the proper viewing distance and angle. A
   transformer-based object detector is used to recognize the installation
   status of building elements, and a progress updating module is developed
   to correlate the detection results with the robot's sensory and BIM
   information to generate a construction progress report for interior
   installation. This framework hierarchically estimates the percentage of
   project completion and allows for tracking of the installation work
   progress. The proposed system has been verified through laboratory and
   onsite experiments using various platforms, including a mobile robot, a
   four-legged robot, a drone, and a smartphone camera.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is
   experiencing a technological revolution driven by booming digitisation
   and automation. Advances in research fields of information technology
   and computer science, such as building information modelling (BIM),
   machine learning and computer vision have attracted growing attention
   owing to their useful applications. At the same time, population-driven
   underground development has been accelerated with digital transformation
   as a strategic imperative. Urban underground infrastructures are
   valuable assets and thus demanding effective planning, construction and
   maintenance. While enabling greater visibility and reliability into the
   processes and subsystems of underground construction, applications of
   BIM, machine learning and computer vision in underground construction
   represent different sets of opportunities and challenges from their use
   in above-ground construction. Therefore, this paper aims to present the
   state-of-the-art development and future trends of BIM, machine learning,
   computer vision and their related technologies in facilitating the
   digital transition of tunnelling and underground construction. Section 1
   presents the global demand for adopting these technologies. Section 2
   introduces the related terminologies, standardisations and fundamentals.
   Section 3 reviews BIM in traditional and mechanised tunnelling and
   highlights the importance of integrating 3D geological modelling and
   geographic information system (GIS) databases with BIM. Section 4
   examines the key applications of machine learning and computer vision at
   different stages of underground construction. Section 5 discusses the
   challenges and perspectives of existing research on leveraging these
   emerging technologies for escalating digitisation, automation and
   information integration throughout underground project lifecycle.
   Section 6 summarises the current state of development, identified gaps
   and future directions.},

Abstract = {Automation technology in the construction industry is the use of
   advanced tools, devices, and processes that reduce manual labor and
   enhance efficiency in various construction activities. Automation
   technology can minimize waste, optimize resource utilization, and reduce
   the environmental impact of construction processes. This study aims to
   examine the relationship between automation technology adoptions (ATAs)
   utilizing reduce, reuse, and recycle (3R), building information modeling
   (BIM), industrialized building systems (IBSs), green building index
   (GBI), and Internet of Things (IoT) practices toward construction site
   performance (CSP) to measure their influences on material waste
   mitigation measures at Johor construction sites. To achieve these goals,
   five hypotheses were developed to explore the association between ATA
   and CSP. Data were gathered utilizing an online survey. The participants
   were contractors and expert practitioners in the Johor construction
   industry, including architects, project managers, and
   academicians/researchers. A total of 257 valid responses were used to
   investigate the assumptions. The partial least squares structural
   equation modeling (PLS-SEM) procedure was used. The findings revealed
   that ATA utilizing 3R, BIM, IBS, GBI, and IoT as material mitigation
   measures positively enhances CSP.},

Title = {SmartBuild RecSys: A Recommendation System Based on the Smart Readiness
   Indicator for Energy Efficiency in Buildings},
Journal = {ALGORITHMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) is a newly developed framework that
   measures a building's technological readiness to improve its energy
   efficiency. The integration of data obtained from this framework with
   data derived from Building Information Modeling (BIM) has the potential
   to yield compelling results. This research proposes an algorithm for a
   Recommendation System (RS) that uses SRI and BIM data to advise on
   building energy-efficiency improvements. Following a modular programming
   approach, the proposed system is split into two algorithmic approaches
   linked with two distinct use cases. In the first use case, BIM data are
   utilized to provide thermal envelope enhancement recommendations. A
   hybrid Machine Learning (ML) (Random Forest-Decision Tree) algorithm is
   trained using an Industry Foundation Class (IFC) BIM model of CERTH'S
   nZEB Smart Home in Greece and Passive House database data. In the second
   use case, SRI data are utilized to develop an RS for Heating,
   Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system improvement, in which a
   process utilizes a filtering function and KNN algorithm to suggest
   automation levels for building service improvements. Considering the
   results from both use cases, this paper provides a solid framework that
   exploits more possibilities for coupling SRI with BIM data. It presents
   a novel algorithm that exploits these data to facilitate the development
   of an RS system for increasing building energy efficiency.},

Abstract = {An average person spends about one-third of their day in the office
   (Naber, 2013), consequently, improving Indoor Environmental Quality
   (IEQ) helps enhance their overall health and productivity. Therefore,
   Facility Management (FM) seeks ways to enhance IEQ to improve overall
   occupants/building performance. With a focus on finding ways to do so,
   this study investigates the integration of Internet of Things (IoT)
   sensors that measure several factors of IEQ with Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) to help FM make decisions based on live data to enhance
   building performance and user satisfaction. The study is conducted on a
   floor of an office building in Cairo, Egypt. Data exported from an IoT
   Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) is integrated and visualized in a Revit
   model through a Dynamo script that also compares the data to standards
   such as the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating the Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA). The FM team assesses the efficiency of the
   tool, then suggestions for improvement are presented. The results
   produce a user-friendly tool that integrates an IoT WSN network to a
   Revit model and shows the updated state and history of six IEQ
   parameters that could be used to ease and support decision-making for FM
   and improve overall building performance.},

Title = {Exchanging Progress Information Using IFC-Based BIM for Automated
   Progress Monitoring},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {BIM has become an intrinsic tool in managing building projects due to
   its ability to comprehensively represent information in digital form.
   However, using BIM as an information exchange tool is still in its
   infancy, particularly with regard to construction progress monitoring
   beyond time schedule information. The current study focuses on the
   development of an automated progress monitoring framework based on an
   IFC-based BIM and provides an extensive methodology based on a
   structured task-based approach in accordance with the latest IFC4.x
   schema in four stages. The first stage creates the appropriate IFC
   entities, which are then enriched with their values in the second stage.
   The third stage integrates the actual progress information, which
   requires regular updating from the construction site. Finally, the
   fourth stage enables the retrieval of progress information, which is
   then reported in a user-friendly format along with the estimation of
   additional progress indicators. The proposed method successfully
   integrated the progress information into their IFC-based BIM models,
   demonstrating its practical use for monitoring construction progress. In
   the end, a web-based application was also developed that made use of
   progress information stored within the standardized hierarchy of the
   updated IFC-based BIM to facilitate efficient reporting.},

Title = {INVARIANT SIGNATURE, LOGIC REASONING, AND SEMANTIC NATURAL LANGUAGE
   PROCESSING (NLP)-BASED AUTOMATED BUILDING CODE COMPLIANCE CHECKING
   (I-SNACC) FRAMEWORK},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {1-18},
Abstract = {Traditional manual building code compliance checking is costly,
   time-consuming, and human error -prone. With the adoption of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM), automation in such a checking process
   becomes more feasible. However, existing methods still face limited
   automation when applied to different building codes. To address that, in
   this paper, the authors proposed a new framework that requires minimal
   input from users and strives for full automation, namely, the Invariant
   signature, logic reasoning, and Semantic Natural language processing
   (NLP)-based Automated building Code compliance Checking (I-SNACC)
   framework. The authors developed an automated building code compliance
   checking (ACC) prototype system under this framework and tested it on
   Chapter 10 of the International Building Codes 2015 (IBC 2015). The
   system was tested on two real projects and achieved 95.2\% precision and
   100\% recall in non-compliance detection. The experiment showed that the
   framework is promising in building code compliance checking. Compared to
   the state-of-the-art methods, the new framework increases the degree of
   automation and saves manual efforts for finding non-compliance cases.},

Title = {Underlying Factors and Strategies for Organizational BIM Capabilities:
   The Case of Iran},
Journal = {APPLIED SYSTEM INNOVATION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has a significant role in the
   architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO)
   industries. Most BIM benefits have not been grasped due to the lack of
   organizational BIM capabilities (OBIMCs). Accordingly, organizations
   must develop intuitive strategies to support BIM implementation and to
   fulfill the promised benefits. This study investigates the impact of
   different capability factors on OBIMC and the underlying strategies to
   improve OBIMC in Iran. Particularly, this study builds a structural
   equation model to explain the links between the capability factors and
   strategies linked to OBIMC in Iran. A systematic literature review of
   twenty-six papers and semi-structured interviews with fifteen BIM
   specialists identified nineteen capability factors and fourteen
   strategies. A survey of 126 BIM professionals was used to assess the
   importance of the capability factors and strategies. To analyze the
   collected data, first, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was
   performed. Then, Partial Least-Squares Structural Equation Modeling
   (PLS-SEM) was employed. The EFA generated two constructs for the
   capability factors: OBIMC and organizational capabilities (OCA).
   Furthermore, it categorized the strategies into two constructs: BIM
   capability requirement (BIMCR) and organizational culture (OCU). The
   structural equation model demonstrates that BIMCR and OCU enhance OCA
   and OBIMC. These two elements are also positively impacted by BIMCR.
   Industry professionals and policymakers can use these findings to
   develop strategic plans and to prioritize efforts. The significant
   contribution of this study is to illuminate the interrelationship
   between capability factors and strategies related to OBIMC in Iran.},

   prototype was developed and validated through a real-life construction
   project. Different OAs were applied and compared, and the genetic
   algorithm was found as the best performing one. The prototype was
   successfully linked with BIM timeliner application. By using this
   approach, the start and finish dates of all object-based activities are
   developed, and the project completion time is automatically
   estimated.Originality/valueUnlike conventional construction estimation
   methods which need various tools and are error prone and time-consuming,
   the developed method bypasses the existing time estimation tools and
   provides the integrated and automated process with BIM and machine
   learning algorithms. Furthermore, this approach integrates 4D BIM
   applications into construction design procedures, connected with OA
   automation.},

Abstract = {Reducing emissions from construction and buildings is pivotal to climate
   change mitigation. Hence, transitioning to a low-carbon emission
   industry is the focus of many countries by applying prefabrication and
   building information modelling (BIM). Although prefabrication and BIM
   contribute towards reducing emissions, the burgeoning body of knowledge
   mostly consider them separate and often neglect advances in their
   synergies towards low-carbon building delivery. More importantly, a
   thorough review of the current state of BIM and prefabrication
   integration is still lacking. Therefore, this study uses the systematic
   review to explore the integration of BIM and prefabrication towards
   low-carbon efforts in building delivery. Six typologies of integrating
   BIM and prefabrication for low-carbon activities were revealed. Thus,
   energy and environmental assessments; visualization and real-time
   monitoring; parametric design optimization; automation in modelling;
   BIM-PC modifications; and information mapping. Further, these typologies
   explored four main low-carbon attributes in building delivery; energy
   evaluation, material selection, waste reduction and process efficiency.
   From the findings, research gaps were identified and future research
   directions such as BIM-based bill of quantities for carbon footprint
   analysis, and circularity features of prefabricated components were
   provided. This study consolidates advances in BIM and prefabrication
   scholarship and informs practice for evaluation of low-carbon processes
   in buildings.},

Abstract = {With the emergence of vast technological advancements in the
   construction industry to address construction issues, BIM is foreseen as
   a potential utilization environment. To expand BIM performance in
   addressing contemporary construction issues, there is currently an
   uprising trend of plugin development. This paper reports a systematic
   review of BIM-based plugins, by exploring their nature, areas of
   application, and their implication on productivity and efficiency. Using
   a systematic review approach, the study narrows down vast literature and
   critically analyses 34 developed plugins from 34 different articles.
   Findings suggest that custom-build plugins are excelling in vast areas
   utilizing key construction processes like automation, including Health
   and Safety and Lifecycle assessments, as they are proven to drive
   productivity and efficiency towards cost and time savings as well as
   error minimization. Moreover, based on the commonalities between the
   extracted plugin systems, a framework that could facilitate a better
   understanding of the programming dynamics in developing BIM-based
   plugins is presented. Value: This paper offers future research of the
   insights needed to better understand the directions of BIM-based plugin
   development and captures BIM evolvement towards more problem-solving
   potentials.},

Abstract = {This paper reveals the results of a bibliometric analysis on BIM and
   architecture to analyze and determine how the current research trends in
   BIM literature have evolved and diversified in the discipline of
   architecture. Although there are currently bibliometric analysis reviews
   of BIM in the literature, these studies take either the BIM process from
   a general perspective or the engineering-construction sectors, urban
   design scale. This state-of-the-art study explains a bibliometric
   analysis of the literature's relationship between architecture and BIM.
   Through analyzing the data including keywords, authors, journals,
   institutions, citation rate etc., the relationship between BIM and
   architecture in all times till today has been mapped and visualized by
   using Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science database and VOS viewer
   program. In addition, analyzing the current literature published between
   2017-2022 was highlighted and the emerging fields in architectural
   research were revealed. Emerging fields today in architectural research
   under the scope of BIM have clustered according to the keywords and
   these keywords are mostly related to information technologies and
   automation. The goal of revealing these findings extensively is to
   inspire future research based on the gaps and missing information in the
   existing literature. The unique importance of this study is to generate
   a knowledge base for the relationship between BIM and architecture
   studies based on the data including keywords, authors, journals,
   universities, citation rate, etc., adopting the bibliometric approach.
   This study provides valuable information to BIM studies in architecture
   research for researchers and practitioners. The current state of the
   research field, trend topics, and the key scholars and universities were

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2024},

Pages = {1005-1025},
Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Purpose - Several studies have addressed the use of four-dimensional
   (4D) building information modeling (BIM) for construction management.
   However, the automation of the processes for generating 4D models and
   their integrated use with Location-Based Planning and the Last
   Planner((R)) System is not well discussed. Therefore, this paper aims to
   develop a method for automating the generation and use of 4D BIM models
   integrated with Location-Based Planning and Last Planner((R)) System
   supporting project control cycles.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research strategy adopted was Design
   Science Research. The automated method for using the 4D models was
   developed and refined in two residential building projects in Brazil,
   along with 31 meetings and involving 11 direct users. The assessment of
   the proposed method focuses on four constructs: the impact of process
   automation, the impact on the identification and assessment of site
   progress and the planning process, ease of adoption and utility of the
   proposed method.
   Findings - The results of this paper indicated increased adherence
   between planned and executed through an automated method for using the
   4D models. The established routines enabled automating the link between
   the planning levels and the three-dimensional (3D) model, providing a
   more agile and updated data source and achieving 92.8\% of user
   satisfaction regarding the deadline and frequency of delivery of the 4D
   model reports. Moreover, this study identified the relationships between
   the processes of the method proposed and Digital Models.
   Originality/value - The primary scientific value achieved in this study
   is creating a method for automating processes and simplifying steps for
   the generation and use of 4D BIM models in the production planning and
   control cycles during the construction phase.},

Title = {Extended Reality for Smart Building Operation and Maintenance: A Review},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The operation and maintenance (O\&M) of buildings and infrastructure
   represent a strategic activity to ensure they perform as expected over
   time and to reduce energy consumption and maintenance costs at the urban
   and building scale. With the increasing diffusion of BIM, IoT devices,
   and AI, the future of O\&M is represented by digital twin technology. To
   effectively take advantage of this digital revolution, thus enabling
   data-driven energy control, proactive maintenance, and predictive daily
   operations, it is vital that smart building management exploits the
   opportunities offered by the extended reality (XR) technologies.
   Nevertheless, in consideration of the novelty of XR in the AECO sector
   and its rapid and ongoing evolution, knowledge of the specific
   possibilities and the methods of integration into the building process
   workflow is still piecemeal and sparse. With the goal to bridge this
   gap, the article presents a thorough review of virtual reality (VR),
   augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) technologies and
   applications for smart building operation and maintenance. After
   defining VR, AR, and MR, the article provides a detailed review that
   analyzes, categorizes, and summarizes state-of-the-art XR technologies
   and their possible applications for building O\&M along with their
   relative advantages and disadvantages. The article concludes that the
   application of XR in building and city management is showing promising
   results in enhancing human performance in technical O\&M tasks, in
   understanding and controlling the energy efficiency, comfort, and safety
   of building and infrastructures, and in supporting strategic decision
   making for the future smart city.},

Title = {Intelligent automation and optimization of reinforced concrete dual

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {To keep pace with the trend of automating structural design processes,
   this paper presents an intelligent framework for generating optimized
   reinforced concrete dual systems (RCDS) based on given architectural
   configurations extracted in IFC format, allowing seamless integration
   with a BIM platform. First, a technique is developed to reduce the
   infinite number of possibilities for column locations on the
   architectural layout to a limited number of potential positions for the
   columns of the frame. Next, a hill climbing algorithm is used to define
   the optimal arrangements and axes for the columns of the building
   skeleton. Finally, a genetic algorithm with multi-objective function is
   applied to generate an optimized structural shear walls layout that fits
   within the predefined skeleton outlines. The performance and sensitivity
   of the proposed pro-cedure are evaluated using three typical
   architectural configurations. The results demonstrate that the framework
   has high capacity for generating optimized RCDSs that comply with
   pre-defined structural design criteria and fit well into the
   architectural layouts.},

Title = {The Revolution of Quantity Surveying Profession in Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) Era: The Malaysian Perspective},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) has becoming the current trend in
   the construction industry where quantity surveying serves as important
   discipline. Undeniably, BIM adoption has brought many advantages due to
   automation of multidimensional model platform that helps Quantity
   Surveyors (QS) to reduce arithmetic errors and removes many tedious
   tasks in conventional approach such as tendering and the production of
   bills of quantities (BQ). BIM will soon replace the traditional
   measurement done by QS if the Standard Method of Measurements (SMM)
   could be integrated in BIM. As a result, it is concerning that
   unemployment of quantity surveyors might be an issue if there is no
   revolution or adaptation of quantity surveying practices with the
   blossoming of BIM implementation in Malaysia. Hence, this research is
   carried out to determine the new skills needed by a quantity surveyor in
   order to keep pace with the implementation of BIM in Malaysia.
   Qualitative research method is used in this study in which
   semi-structured interview was carried out with 20 experienced QS that
   applies BIM technology in their practices. Data abstracted from the
   transcript of interviews was then coded though NVivo 12 Pro and analyzed
   by using content analysis method. At the end of the study, the findings
   revealed that the QS must attain IT skills and BIM software knowledge to
   align with BIM drive. It is thus recommended that thorough provisions of
   integrating traditional methods of quantifying and costing building
   projects with cutting edge technologies must be included in BIM standard
   to ensure that BIM can be adopted at its best in the profession with
   increase performance.},

Title = {Object verification based on deep learning point feature comparison for
   scan-to-BIM},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Building information models (BIMs) have been widely adopted in current
   construction projects to enhance the efficiency of facility maintenance
   operations. As-built BIMs can reflect the actual conditions of
   facilities and thus as-built BIM reconstruction has shown great
   significance in digital twin generation, building health monitoring,
   facility management and urban renewal. Laser scanners are capable to
   capture dense 3D measurements of the environment in a fast and highly
   accurate way. Therefore, laser scanning data have been widely used for
   as-built BIM generation. Although research efforts have been made on how
   to automatically achieve ``Scan-to-BIM ``, there are still gaps from
   applying current solutions to real scenarios. One of the challenges is
   that some irrelevant point clusters may be wrongly recognized as the
   desired object in the detection stage. This study presents a novel
   object verification approach based on deep learning point feature
   comparison to improve the accuracy of automated BIM reconstruction
   process. Firstly, a KPConv-based deep neural network is developed and
   trained to perform 3D point feature computation. Then through comparing
   point features calculated for extracted point clusters and as -designed
   BIM generated point clouds, point feature distance maps are generated.
   Afterwards, to automatically analyze the generated feature distance
   maps, a dataset including simulated positive and negative instances is
   created based on ModelNet40. And a tiny neural network is established
   and trained on the prepared dataset to acquire ability of
   distinguishment. To validate the feasibility of the proposed technique,
   experiments were conducted on both artificial point clouds and real scan
   data collected in one MEP room in a water treatment work in Hong Kong.
   It is demonstrated that the proposed technique can successfully filter
   out all the false positives in the Scan-to-BIM process, improving
   reconstruction accuracy significantly.},

   Heritage for Semi-Automatic Scan-to-BIM Reconstruction},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We propose a semi-automatic Scan-to-BIM reconstruction approach, making
   the most of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, for the
   classification of digital architectural heritage data. Nowadays,
   Heritage- or Historic-Building Information Modeling (H-BIM)
   reconstruction from laser scanning or photogrammetric surveys is a
   manual, time-consuming, overly subjective process, but the emergence of
   AI techniques, applied to the realm of existing architectural heritage,
   is offering new ways to interpret, process and elaborate raw digital
   surveying data, as point clouds. The proposed methodological approach
   for higher-level automation in Scan-to-BIM reconstruction is threaded as
   follows: (i) semantic segmentation via Random Forest and import of
   annotated data in 3D modeling environment, broken down class by class;
   (ii) reconstruction of template geometries of classes of architectural
   elements; (iii) propagation of template reconstructed geometries to all
   elements belonging to a typological class. Visual Programming Languages
   (VPLs) and reference to architectural treatises are leveraged for the
   Scan-to-BIM reconstruction. The approach is tested on several
   significant heritage sites in the Tuscan territory, including
   charterhouses and museums. The results suggest the replicability of the
   approach to other case studies, built in different periods, with
   different construction techniques or under different states of
   conservation.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe objective of this research is to develop an solution to water
   management at the scale of buildings, through the technological
   resources. Automating analysis using 3D models helps increase efficiency
   in buildings during the operational phase, consequently promotes
   sustainability.Design/methodology/approachThis study presents a
   methodology based on Design Science Research to automate water
   management at building scale integrating BIM-IoT-FM. Data from smart
   meters (IoT) and the BIM model were integrated to be applied in
   facilities management (FM) to improve performance of the building. The
   methodology was implemented in a prototype for the web, called AquaBIM,
   which captures, manages and analyzes the information.FindingsThe
   application of AquaBIM allowed the theoretical evaluation and practical
   validation of water management methodology. By BIM-IoT integration, the
   consumption parameters and ranges for 17 categories of activities were
   determined to contribute to fulfill the research gap for the commercial
   buildings. This criterion and other requirements are requirements met in
   order to obtain the AQUA-HQE environmental sustainability
   certification.Practical implicationsTraditionally, water management in
   buildings is based on scarce data. The practical application of digital
   technologies improves decision-making. Moreover, the creation of
   consumption indicators for commercial buildings contributes to the
   discussion in the field of knowledge.Originality/valueThis article
   emphasizes the investigation of the efficiency of use in commercial
   buildings using operational data and the use of sustainable consumption
   indicators to manage water consumption.},

   BIM-to-BoT (B2B) framework},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},

Abstract = {Robotics hold immense potential to transform the industrialized
   construction (IC) sector by enhancing productivity, drawing on its
   similarities with the manufacturing industry. However, the unique nature
   of construction projects and the demand for customized building designs
   present substantial technological hurdles for incorporating robotics
   into IC activities. The time and cost burdens of the project- and
   task-driven reprogramming of robotic systems can outweigh the perceived
   benefits of robotics-based automation. Those burdens are further
   compounded by the notable lack of research addressing the technical
   collaboration issues between virtual design and construction software,
   specifically Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools, and commercially
   available robotic software suites. This research aims to promote the
   adoption of construction robotics by streamlining the
   design-to-manufacturing processes of framing tasks in IC. The proposed
   framework is integrated into a software platform that establishes a
   collaborative environment for BIM and assembly-based robotics in panel
   framing tasks of IC, referred to as BIM-to-Bot (B2B). This platform uses
   architectural BIM models from Revit and automatically converts building
   design information into shop drawings and robotics-based manufacturing
   procedures for a multi-robot system designed specifically for framing
   tasks in IC. The proposed framework was evaluated through a case study
   revealing significant efficiency improvements. The drafting process
   improved by 93.33\%, and the robotic programming process improved by
   88.66\% when using the proposed method compared to manual drafting and
   programming, resulting in an 89.34\% time savings in BIM-to-Robot
   processes. By enabling the integration of robotics into panel framing
   tasks, this research bridges the crucial gap between building designs
   and robotic assembly. The enhanced efficiency associated with the
   proposed streamlined design-tomanufacturing processes is expected to
   pave the way for the broader adoption of robotics in the construction
   industry, heralding a new era of IC.},

Title = {Environmental optimization and benchmarking of walls through a BIM
   plugin},
Journal = {ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING AND DESIGN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JAN 4},
Abstract = {Despite substantial progress in sustainable building design, a
   significant gap remains in the integration of building information
   modeling (BIM) and life cycle assessment (LCA); specifically, a gap
   exists in the optimization of the LCA design. The present study
   addresses this gap by presenting a BIM plugin that incorporates the LCA
   to optimize the design of sustainable buildings. Benchmarks were studied
   in the literature review, leading to a proposal for the optimized
   integration of the BIM-LCA tool. This innovative tool enables the
   evaluation of multiple environmental impacts, such as global warming
   potential, abiotic depletion potential, acidification potential,
   eutrophication potential, ozone depletion potential, and photochemical
   ozone creation potential, during the design stages. In addition to
   calculating the impacts, the plugin offers designers a range of
   construction system options ranked by their environmental impact, as
   long as the automation of the BIM object replacement is included in the
   project to facilitate design solution benchmarking and informed
   decision-making to reduce carbon emissions. A case study demonstrates
   the utility and effectiveness of this BIM-LCA integration tool
   specifically designed to integrate benchmarking in optimized wall
   design, thereby advancing sustainable building design practices
   following the European directives for sustainability (CEN, 2019) and a
   level(s) framework (EC, 2021).},

Title = {Factors affecting BIM implementation in Saudi Arabia: a critical
   analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 24},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study examines the underlying relationships between the
   critical factors of building information modeling (BIM) implementation
   and the factors' groupings among architecture, engineering and
   construction (AEC) organizations in Saudi Arabia. The objectives of the
   study are to (1) identify the critical factors for BIM implementation,
   (2) analyze the interrelationships between the critical factors and (3)
   compare the critical factors between the different organizational
   characteristics.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, potential factors were identified
   through a systematic literature review and interviews with AEC
   professionals. Then, a questionnaire survey was sent to AEC
   professionals and the collected data were analyzed using the following
   techniques and tests: mean score ranking, standard deviation, normalized
   value, factor analysis (FA), analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc
   Tukey test.
   Findings - The analyses show that 14 factors are critical for BIM
   implementation in Saudi Arabia. The top critical factors include the
   existence of standard contracts on data security and user
   confidentiality, consistent views on BIM among stakeholders and the
   availability of guidelines for implementing BIM. Of the 14 critical
   factors, 9 can be grouped into 4 underlying factors: environmental,
   governmental, legal and organizational. The analysis shows that the
   criticality of the most critical factors grouped by the FA varies
   between different levels of BIM competency. Finally, the presence of
   public-private partnerships (PPPs) in realizing BIM projects is a new
   and emerging critical factor for BIM implementation in Saudi Arabia.
   Originality/value - This study differs from prior works on BIM
   implementation in Saudi Arabia by using FA to explore the underlying
   relationships among factors of BIM implementation and the factors'
   groupings. Based on the FA results, a roadmap for implementing the BIM
   was developed. These findings will help to purposefully and efficiently
   customize BIM implementation strategies and initiatives to ensure
   successful BIM implementation in Saudi Arabia.},

Abstract = {Monitoring and management of construction sites are critical to ensuring
   project success, efficiency, and safety. Traditional methods often
   struggle to provide real-time, accurate, and comprehensive data, leading
   to delays, cost overruns, and errors. This paper presents a novel
   methodology utilising a ground drone for auditing construction sites to
   detect changes and deviations from planned Building Information
   Modelling (BIM). The methodology focuses on developing a novel tool that
   facilitates Scan-vs-BIM auditing through time. Experimental results are
   presented, demonstrating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed
   methodology for assessing structural discrepancies. This research
   contributes to advancing construction auditing practices by integrating
   state-of-the-art technologies and innovative techniques, ultimately
   enhancing project monitoring and management processes in the

Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Real utilisation patterns often only become apparent when a building is
   put into operation. Since planning is therefore based on several
   assumptions, the potential of building technology is often limited.
   Post-occupancy evaluations offer the potential to adapt operation to
   real usage patterns and draw conclusions for future planning, thereby
   improving performance. Although solution approaches are available in the
   literature, this potential is currently hardly being utilised. A survey
   in the construction industry is therefore used to compare market
   requirements with existing solution concepts. The results emphasise the
   relevance of auto-commissioning, contractual agreements on performance
   evaluation and the coupling of digital twins with post-occupancy
   evaluations. A stronger anchoring of the control industry in BIM is
   proving to be necessary for better crossdisciplinary collaboration
   between all parties involved. Even though the focus of this study is on
   lighting, the most important findings are in principle transferable to
   other trades.},

Abstract = {The buildings natural ageing along with the absence of planned
   maintenance actions and the effects of climate changes accelerate the
   building materials degradation. So, to extend the materials' service

   Information Modelling(BIM) as a supporting tool for Building Condition
   Assessment-(BCA) and maintenance management. To achieve these goals a
   methodology was proposed and applied to a case study involving 1)
   Building data collection; 2) Building Life Cycle Cost estimation, and 3)
   Automated calculation of Building Performance Indicator. This research
   application highlights the importance of BIM role in buildings' Facility
   Management, allowing the model's permanent update of information, in
   this case for BCA purposes. It also has high potential to prioritize the
   building maintenance actions, extending its materials service life,

Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The current maintenance management method affects the efficiency of the
   complex, high-rise industrialised building system (IBS) building
   maintenance management projects in Malaysia. The usage of a conventional
   system (paper-based reports/unsystematic database) has various
   drawbacks, such as IBS component aesthetic and structural defects which
   occur repeatedly in the building and maintenance of conventional
   building, lack of integration between maintenance systems and lack of
   the intelligent capabilities of linking defect diagnosis operations in
   maintenance affecting various building elements with IBS component
   defect knowledge. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the
   development of a mechanism to improve IBS component defect knowledge
   transfer in IBS building maintenance projects through the integration of
   building information modelling (BIM).
   Design/methodology/approach
   Eight clients/maintenance contractors were selected based on the major
   problems of using a conventional system to investigate the maintenance
   management practices in each complex and high-rise IBS building.
   Findings
   The findings indicated that several computerised systems such as
   Building Automation System and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
   System are used by a client/maintenance contractor. Moreover, BIM
   technology awareness was found to be limited, with no implementation in
   IBS building maintenance till now. The results of this case study were
   used as a foundation for the development of a prototype system using
   Computerised Maintenance Management System, Expert System and BIM.
   Originality/value
   The development of this new system improves IBS component diagnosis
   knowledge integration with the BIM technology.},

Abstract = {Purpose Although building information modelling (BIM) brings various
   benefits and open up the construction industry to many new
   possibilities, it is not without some challenges. Blockchain has the
   potential to resolve some of these problems. It has shown that
   blockchain and BIM can potentially work together in bringing various
   benefits to all project stakeholders. However, there is a lack of
   research and knowledge in relation to blockchain-based BIM. Therefore,
   the purpose of this study is to close this gap by looking into the
   potential functionality and workability of blockchain within a BIM
   environment. Design/methodology/approach A four-stage preferred
   reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses systematic
   literature review technique has been used to review the blockchain- and
   BIM-related information sources published. A total of 53 journal
   articles, 13 books and 27 other resources including that of reports and
   websites have been included in this paper. Findings Blockchain-based BIM
   has countless possibilities, ranging from simple tasks such as tracking
   of orders to automation of construction payment claims. The literatures
   have suggested that the several weaknesses that BIM possesses including
   trust issue, asset ownership issue and data reliability issue could be
   resolved by incorporating blockchain into its processes.
   Originality/value Because of the lack of researches on the workability
   of blockchain and BIM, this paper aims to close this gap by proposing a
   framework for the interaction between blockchain and BIM for a typical
   building project. This paper has reviewed a substantial amount of
   currently available knowledge on blockchain-based BIM and its relevancy
   to the construction industry. This paper believes that the information
   could be of use to potential BIM tools maker and the construction
   industry for the betterment of BIM implementation throughout a project

   system based on digitized data from sensors in each device that is
   connected to the system. The system monitored the operation of each
   device in real time and sent messages to maintenance personnel in case
   of any abnormality in each device. This system ensured the normal
   operation of the building and saved costs and energy via efficient
   functions. The system was developed and implemented for one year. The
   operation outcome showed the completeness, relevance, standardization,
   and visualization of collected data and information. It also enabled the
   effective scheduling of operation and maintenance by querying the data
   from each device for intelligent building management.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {The high number of accidents in the construction sector makes the
   concept of prevention through design (PtD), which starts with the
   integration of an occupational risk assessment in this phase,
   increasingly important. To this end, BIM (building information
   modelling) is a methodology that provides benefits related to the
   management of health and safety in the design phase. Its application in
   linear work projects is less developed than its application in building,
   even more so with regard to health and safety in BIM. This research
   proposes a methodology for integrating risk assessment into the design
   phase of BIM road projects, structuring the information, establishing
   the information integration processes, its analysis and risk management,
   and automating its integration into the model through zones. As a
   result, the research enables risk assessment in the BIM model through
   zones, differentiating risk values and allowing for the analysis of
   interferences between certain activities and the study of other specific
   activities in the design. As a result of the structure and organisation
   of the data, it is possible to export the data to IFC for coordination
   with other stakeholders. Thus, the final contribution of the research is
   the introduction of health and safety into road projects conducted with
   BIM, in compliance with legal requirements.},

Title = {Adapting to an OpenBIM Building Permit Process: A Case Study Using the
   Example of the City of Vienna},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The adoption of building information modelling (BIM) enables data-driven
   decision-making for many participants in the construction process.
   Building authorities are stakeholders that have not yet benefited from
   data integration using BIM. In many cases, parts of their processes have
   already improved through digitisation initiatives. Now they are on the
   threshold of a major digital transformation enabled by the integration
   of BIM into their processes. This study examines a building permit
   process based entirely on BIM, developed at the Vienna Building
   Authority in Austria. In a series of workshops with all important
   stakeholders, the current building permit process was captured in detail
   and transferred to a data-driven, BIM-based process. The study shows
   that the complete capture and digitisation of the building approval
   process not only enables the automation of traditional processes such as
   code compliance checks and neighbourhood hearings but also supports the
   introduction of innovative sub-processes such as a pre-check of BIM
   models and augmented reality-based hearings with neighbours (in a pilot
   phase). The results suggest that the developed process not only
   significantly increases the efficiency and transparency of building
   permit procedures, but also represents a decisive step towards
   integrating the authority into the BIM process of a building.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {128},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Data exchange and management methods are of paramount importance in
   areas as complex as the Architecture, Engineering and Construction
   industries and Facility Management. For example, Big Open BIM requires
   seamless information flow among an arbitrary number of applications. The
   backbone of such information flow is a robust integration, whose tasks
   include overcoming technological as well as semantic and pragmatic gaps
   and conflicts both within and between data models. In this work, we
   introduce a method for integrating the pragmatics at design-time and the
   semantics of independent applications at run-time into so-called
   ``integration facades{''}. We utilize Model-driven Engineering for the
   automatic discovery of functionalities and data models, and for finding
   a user-guided consensus. We present a case study involving the domains
   of architecture, building physics and structural engineering for
   evaluating our approach in object-oriented as well as data-oriented
   programming environments. The results produce, for each scenario, a
   single integration facade that acts as a single source of truth in the
   data exchange process.},

Title = {Automation of Construction Progress Monitoring by Integrating 3D Point
   Cloud Data with an IFC-Based BIM Model},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Automated construction progress monitoring using as-planned building
   information modeling (BIM) and as-built point cloud data integration has
   substantial potential and could lead to the fast-tracking of
   construction work and identifying discrepancies. Laser scanning is
   becoming mainstream for conducting construction surveys due to the
   accuracy of the data obtained and the speed of the process; however,
   construction progress monitoring techniques are still limited because of
   the complexity of the methods, incompleteness of the scanned areas, or
   the obstructions by temporary objects in construction sites. The novel
   method proposed within this study enables the extracting of BIM data,
   calculating the plane equation of the faces, and performing a
   point-to-plane distance estimation, which successfully overcomes some
   limitations reported in previous studies, including automated object
   detection in an occluded environment. Six datasets consisting of point
   clouds collected by static and mobile laser scanning techniques
   including the corresponding BIM models were analyzed. In all the
   analyzed cases, the proposed method automatically detected whether the
   construction of an object was completed or not in the as-built point
   cloud compared to the provided as-planned BIM model.},

Title = {A type-2 fuzzy system-based approach for image data fusion to create
   building information models},
Journal = {INFORMATION FUSION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {115-125},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a standard digital process that
   fuses buildings information from different sources into a 3D model
   during their lifecycle. For new construction sites using BIM, it is
   possible to monitor the cost, schedule, and changes throughout the
   lifecycle; however, existing buildings do not have a BIM model. Manually
   creating the BIM models for existing buildings is a high-cost task, both
   in time and money, hence there is a need for extracting information from
   available paper-based documentation and fuse it into a BIM model. The
   struggle of facility management and utility companies to fully adopt a
   BIM process (due to their high volumes of paper-based documentation of
   existing buildings) has led to the research on creating these 3D BIM
   models from 2D floor plan images.
   This paper presents a novel processing pipeline to extract 2D digital
   information from floorplans, fusing it into a 3D BIM model. The work
   focuses on fusing the available information to create the structure of
   the building in BIM format, which is considered the essential step
   before looking on working with other sources of data. In this process,
   we introduce a type-2 fuzzy logic based Explainable Artificial
   Intelligence (XAI) approach for the semantic segmentation step. The
   approach consists of using the outputs of type-2 fuzzy logic systems to
   classify a pixel as wall or background, by using information around and
   from the pixel of interest as the inputs to the system. After the
   semantic segmentation step, the output of the type-2 fuzzy logic goes
   through a noise removal process and finally a transformation from 2D to
   3D by assigning the corresponding BIM tag to each identified element.
   The proposed type-2 fuzzy logic semantic segmentation approach produced
   comparable results (97.3\% mean Intersection over Union (IoU)
   performance metric value) to the opaque box model approach based on
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (99.3\% mean IoU performance metric
   value). However, the type-2 fuzzy XAI system benefits from being an
   augmentable and interpretable model, which means that human users can
   understand the decision process and modify the model using their expert
   knowledge.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 9},
Abstract = {Facility management (FM) is the most extended phase of the entire life
   cycle of buildings and incurs the highest expenses. However, limited
   quality drawings and historical data make information flow more
   complicated for many existing buildings and lead to inefficient FM. This
   research proposes a systematic and comprehensive reality point cloud
   model-based framework to support the FM process with feasible visual
   data collection. Specifically, this framework covers an end-to-end
   workflow of using a reality model to implement FM strategies, including
   visual data capture process for generating a reality model; FM
   information attachment in a reality model for issue queries; and
   information flow for issue tracking. The resulting reality model
   captures with critical and necessary FM data input can be used as an
   asset information model (AIM). We have also defined stakeholders'
   responsibilities in implementing FM and how the data are transferred,
   updated, and used within a reality point cloud-based AIM by
   stakeholders. The framework is evaluated by interviewing FM experts, and
   the results demonstrate that implementing the framework could improve
   the FM process's efficiency by using reality models.},

Title = {Enhanced clash detection in building information modeling: Leveraging
   modified extreme gradient boosting for predictive analytics},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study introduces an intelligent system that involves the Modified
   Extreme Gradient Boosting (MXGBoost) algorithm to help improve clash
   detection in Building Information Modeling (BIM) processes. It will
   automate the clash detection among the architectural, civil, mechanical,
   electrical, and plumbing (MEP) disciplines while greatly enhancing the
   coordination of projects with minimal errors to improve performance in
   construction projects. The implemented model of the Mean Absolute Error
   (MAE) of 0.057, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0034, an Area Under the
   Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.972, an R-squared
   (R2) value of 0.928, and a precision rate of 0.941. The result justifies
   the model's performance and identifies its potential to streamline
   predictive analytics in BIM concerning clash detection. This system
   integrated into the BIM workflow is a severe turn toward cost efficiency
   and a decrease in most project timelines. This work represents one of
   the key steps toward automated BIM coordination, heralding the beginning
   of a new frontier for the industry and providing construction
   professionals with the much-needed tools to operate such projects
   effectively.},

Abstract = {Purpose Rejecting building information modeling (BIM) can negatively
   impact the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) industries.
   While BIM is trending globally, its implementation in post-conflict
   low-income economies is still limited. The purpose of this paper is to
   identify the critical factors for implementing BIM in a post-conflict
   low-income economy, using Afghanistan as a case study.
   Design/methodology/approach This study identifies potential affecting
   factors for BIM implementation through reviewing existing literature and
   interviewing AEC professionals in Afghanistan. Then, the factors are
   inserted into a questionnaire survey and disseminated with Afghanistan's
   AEC practitioners. The collected data was analyzed to determine the
   critical factors. Also, the underlying relationships between the
   critical factors were established through factor analysis. Findings A
   total of 11 critical factors are affecting BIM implementation in
   Afghanistan. From those, nine factors can be grouped into the following
   three components: technological, environmental and organizational. Two
   factors, ``cost-benefit of implementing BIM{''} and ``market demand for
   BIM,{''} are recurring in low- and middle-income economies. Conversely,
   the ``presence of appropriate projects to implement BIM{''} is the
   unique critical factor for Afghanistan that might affect other
   post-conflict low-income economies. Originality/value This study focuses
   on affecting factors for BIM implementation in post-conflict low-income
   economies, using Afghanistan as a reference rather than other types of
   economies that have been widely studied.},

Title = {Enhancing Building Energy Efficiency through Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and Building Energy Modeling (BEM) Integration: A
   Systematic Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {With the ever-increasing population and historic highest energy demand,
   the energy efficiency of buildings is becoming crucial. Architectural
   firms are moving from traditional Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to BIM.
   However, nearly 40\% of the energy consumption is due to buildings.
   Therefore, there is a need to integrate BIM with Building Energy
   Modeling (BEM), which presents an innovative opportunity to demonstrate
   the potential of BIM to minimize energy consumption by integrating
   building information software with data from existing energy-efficient
   building automation systems (EBAS). BEM is a form of computational
   analysis that can be used in conjunction with BIM or Computer-Aided
   Engineering (CAE) systems. In this paper, an attempt has been made to
   explore the existing literature on BIM and BEM and identify the effect
   of the integration of BEM in BIM in the design phase of the project. A
   recent survey from the last ten years (2012 to 2023) was carried out on
   Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus databases.
   Inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied, and papers were scrutinized.
   From the results, it can be observed that the convergence of BIM and BEM
   is found to be useful in practical applications; however, projects with
   short life cycles might not be suitable for this solution. Challenges
   exist in the interoperability tools which have restrictions on data
   exchange. Binary translation is found to be the most suitable candidate
   for data exchange. The analysis further showed that the most used
   program for integrating BIM/BEM is Green Building Studio developed by
   Autodesk to improve construction and operational efficiencies.},

Title = {Drivers for the adoption of building information modelling (BIM) for
   post-construction management in the Nigerian AECO industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {137-153},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to investigate the drivers influencing the
   adoption of building information modelling (BIM) for post-construction
   management in the architecture, engineering, construction and operations
   (AECO) industry, specifically focusing on International Facility
   Management Association (IFMA) registered professionals in Abuja,
   Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative approach was
   employed, using a purposive sampling technique. In total, 132 valid
   responses were analysed using statistical tools such as Cronbach's
   alpha, mean, one sample t-test, Kruskal-Wallis, factor and correction
   analysis. Findings - Result shows that flexibility among industry
   stakeholders towards adopting new technology and safety/emergency
   management are the most critical drivers. All the identified drivers
   were significant (p < 0.05). Kruskal-Wallis's analysis shows that
   professionals have similar opinions on the BIM drivers. Factor analysis
   categorises the drivers into seven components: availability and usage of
   software, increased efficiency, improved performance, safety and
   resources, change in method of operation, improved profitability and
   government intervention. Positive correlations connect BIM software
   availability with efficiency, performance, safety, resource management,
   operational changes, profitability and government support. Research
   limitations/implications - One limitation of this study is the focus on
   a specific group of professionals in Abuja, which may limit the
   generalisability of findings to the broader Nigerian AECO industry.
   Future research should consider a more diverse sample. In addition,
   qualitative research methods could provide deeper insights into the
   qualitative aspects of BIM adoption. Originality/value - This research
   contributes to the existing body of knowledge by providing empirical
   evidence of the drivers influencing BIM adoption in the
   post-construction phase, particularly in Nigeria.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents an innovation in the
   architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. In the
   environmental context, the management of buildings through BIM
   contributes to preserving resources and promoting more sustainable
   environments. This research explores the application of BIM in
   construction and demolition waste (CDW) management and the
   sustainability of buildings. The method consisted of applying Design
   Science Research (DSR) to develop a conceptual information model based
   on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to meet CDW indicators and to
   assist in the CDW management activity. The conceptual model presented a
   perspective on application in CDW management and emphasized the
   importance of mapping information exchanges in BIM to optimize
   activities in civil construction. However, the results depend directly
   on the information available in the IFC model. The proposed conceptual
   model presents the potential to automate waste management with the
   flexibility of applying it to different phases of the construction life
   cycle. The results of CDW management can contribute to other types of
   sustainability analyses.},

Abstract = {The management of the life cycle of large publicly owned social housing
   complexes requires a large amount of human and technological resources,
   the optimization of which is a desirable and shared objective. This
   article proposes a workflow for the enhancement of these management
   processes based on BIM (Building Information Modelling), a methodology
   capable of integrating architectural information into a
   three-dimensional graphic model. The proposed workflow defines the basic
   characteristics of the BIM model oriented toward sustainable building
   management and its relationship with the key moments of its life cycle.
   It also analyzes the architectural information associated with the
   models and determines which parameters are optimal for their completion
   from the BIM models in terms of reliability, auditability, and
   automation. For this purpose, a case study has been developed for a
   multifamily residential building in Malaga (Spain), owned by the
   Andalusian Housing and Rehabilitation Agency AVRA, a public agency that
   manages a housing stock of more than 70,000 dwellings.},

   throughout their life cycle stages, such as design, construction,
   management, monitoring, and operation. In recent years, the automation
   of these processes has been favored by the use of visual programming
   (VP) tools that have replaced conventional programming languages for
   visual schemes. The use of these tools in architectural projects is
   becoming increasing popular. However, this is not the case in
   infrastructure projects, for which the use of VP algorithms remains
   scarce. The aim of this work is to encourage both scholars and engineers
   to implement VP tools in infrastructure projects. For this purpose, this
   work reviews, for the first time in the literature, the state-of-the-art
   and future research trends of VP tools in infrastructure projects.},

Title = {Align to locate: Registering photogrammetric point clouds to BIM for
   robust indoor localization},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {209},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Indoor localization is critical for many smart applications in built
   environments such as service robot navigation and facility management.
   Building information models (BIMs) provide new streams of spatial and
   visual information about building interiors that can be exploited for
   robust indoor localization. However, previous localization methods that
   used BIM were unable to achieve high precision and accuracy, limiting
   their practical applications. To address this challenge, a new approach,
   ``align-to-locate (A2L) ``, is proposed in this study to leverage BIM as
   a reference to rectify and fine-tune coarse camera poses estimated by
   photogrammetry. The camera pose rectification is achieved using a new
   registration algorithm that aligns a photogrammetric point cloud with a
   BIM-referenced point cloud. The experiments demonstrated the
   effectiveness of the proposed A2L approach, which outperformed the state
   of the art with a localization error of 1.07 m and an orientation
   deviation of 3.7. It was also found that query point clouds generated
   from photographs taken along the lateral or longitude directions are
   more conducive for registration. While increasing the number of data
   collection locations and images from each location can provide higher
   accuracy, this approach may compromise the computational speed. This
   study contributes to the challenging indoor localization problem by
   proposing the A2L approach and evaluating its applicability for more
   robust camera pose estimation through point-cloud-to-BIM registration.
   The developed A2L approach can be integrated as a post-processing module
   in existing vision based localization methods to fine-tune their
   estimated camera poses.},

   Performance of Buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The significance of fire inspection has been underscored to prevent
   building fires, which can lead to property damage and loss of life.
   While previous studies employed building information modeling (BIM) to
   evaluate fire safety performance, they primarily focused on a building's
   physical characteristics, overlooking environmental factors. To address
   this limitation, we propose a framework of BIM-based quantitative
   evaluation, which incorporates both physical and environmental
   characteristics of buildings to enhance their fire safety performance.
   We conducted a case study featuring three scenarios to validate the
   proposed framework. The results demonstrate that Scenario 3, with a
   score of 60.3 points, outperforms Scenarios 1 (30.9 points) and 2 (38.2
   points) in terms of fire safety performance. This is attributed to
   Scenario 3's consideration of components, firefighting equipment, and
   environmental elements in preventing and responding to building fires.
   The proposed framework contributes to the field by automatically
   evaluating buildings' fire safety performance using a comprehensive
   approach based on BIM.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {168},

Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Quantification and optimisation of Construction Waste (CW) in the design
   stages are vital to implementing preventive CW management measures.
   Previous ICT-integrated CW models are not efficiently upscaled to
   achieve an interoperable and automated workflow. Therefore, this paper
   presents a BIM-integrated semantic framework for CW quantification and
   optimisation from the early design stages. A CW data model using
   Semantic-Web-Technologies (SWT) was developed and integrated with BIM.
   The results proved that unified data structure, standardised and
   granular information, established semantic relationships between
   building material and CW data, and diverse measurement units proposed in
   the framework facilitate seamless and dynamic information flows between
   BIM and CW platforms. The research outcomes are critical to improving
   interoperability and automation across the CW assessment process,
   enhancing the accuracy and reliability of results, supporting timely and
   integrated decision-making, and easing communication and collaboration
   among the supply-chain members. A test-case building demonstrates the

Title = {Automatic Scan-to-BIM-The Impact of Semantic Segmentation Accuracy},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Scan-to-BIM is the process of converting point cloud data into a
   Building Information Model (BIM) that has proven essential for the AEC
   industry. Scan-to-BIM consists of two fundamental tasks-semantic
   segmentation and 3D reconstruction. Deep learning has proven useful for
   semantic segmentation, and its integration into the Scan-to-BIM workflow
   can benefit the automation of BIM reconstruction. Given the rapid
   advancement of deep learning algorithms in recent years, it is crucial
   to analyze how their accuracy impacts reconstruction quality. In this
   study, we compare the performance of five deep learning
   models-PointNeXt, PointMetaBase, PointTransformer V1, PointTransformer
   V3, and Swin3D-and examine their influence on wall reconstruction. We
   propose a novel yet simple workflow that integrates deep learning and
   RANSAC for reconstructing walls, a fundamental architectural element.
   Interestingly, our findings reveal that even when semantic segmentation
   accuracy is lower, reconstruction accuracy may still be high. Swin3D
   consistently outperformed the other models in both tasks, while
   PointNeXt, despite weaker segmentation, demonstrated high reconstruction
   accuracy. PTV3, with its faster performance, is a viable option, whereas
   PTV1 and PointMetaBase delivered subpar results. We provide insights
   into why this occurred based on the architectural differences among the
   deep learning models evaluated. To ensure reproducibility, our study
   exclusively utilizes open-source software and Python 3.11 for
   processing, allowing future researchers to replicate and build upon our
   workflow.},

Abstract = {Despite the acknowledged promises of adopting technologies such as BIM

   the implementation of the proposed system in a real project. Despite the
   challenges cited in the post-implementation survey (e.g., system

Abstract = {Pathfinding is a fundamental problem for many areas, e.g., robotics,
   automation, computer-aided design, and computer graphics. Although
   outdoor pathfinding is fledged, indoor pathfinding remains a challenge
   due to the lack of indoor maps. Currently, some efforts have utilized
   building information modeling (BIM) to generate either the grid-based
   map or the topological map. However, either the grid-based map or the
   topological map is not sufficient to provide accurate and efficient
   pathfinding service. This article proposes a novel grid-topological map
   and develops an accurate and efficient indoor pathfinding scheme based
   on BIM. The grid-topological map is modeled jointly adopting the
   advantages of both the grid-based map and the topological map. First,
   the grid-based map is generated using the BIM data by extracting and
   mapping geometric and semantic data into planar grids. Second, a grid
   thinning algorithm is proposed to produce the topological map directly
   using the grid-based map. Third, a grid-topological map is presented by
   combining both the grid-based map and topological map. On top of the
   grid-topological map, an accurate and efficient pathfinding algorithm is
   developed. Empirical studies proved the effectiveness of the
   grid-topological map, as well as the accuracy and efficiency of the
   proposed indoor pathfinding algorithm.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to empirically analyze the symmetries and
   asymmetries among the critical factors affecting building information
   modeling (BIM) implementation between countries with different income
   levels. To achieve that aim, the study objectives are to identify:
   critical factors affecting BIM implementation in low-, lower-middle-,
   upper-middle- and high-income countries; overlapping critical factors
   between countries with different income levels; and agreements on the
   critical factors between countries with different income levels.
   Design/methodology/approach This study identified potential BIM
   implementation factors using a systematic literature review and
   semi-structured interviews with architectural, engineering and
   construction (AEC) professionals. Then, the factors were inserted into a
   questionnaire survey and sent to AEC professionals in Afghanistan,
   India, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. The collected data was analyzed using
   the following techniques and tests: mean, standard deviation, normalized
   value, Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn and Mann-Whitney. Findings Five critical
   factors overlap between all countries: ``availability of guidelines for
   implementing BIM,{''} ``cost-benefit of implementing BIM,{''}
   ``stakeholders' willingness to learn the BIM method,{''} ``consistent
   views on BIM between stakeholders{''} and ``existence of standard
   contracts on liability and risk allocation.{''} Also, the criticality of
   the factors often differs between income levels, especially between low-
   and high-income countries, suggesting a significant gap between low- and
   high-income countries in BIM implementation. Originality/value This
   study differs from prior works by empirically analyzing the symmetries
   and asymmetries in BIM implementation factors between countries with
   different income levels (i.e. low-, lower-middle-, upper-middle- and
   high-income countries).},

Title = {Automated BIM-based process for wind engineering design collaboration},
Journal = {BUILDING SIMULATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) can be considered a collaborative
   design process that allows all project stakeholders in different
   disciplines to contribute during the design phase of a construction
   project. However, interoperability issues between wind, structural
   engineering tools, and BIM design authoring software platforms have
   acted as a barrier to such collaborative design processes. This research
   pursued an evaluation-based approach to propose and develop a workflow
   for resolving the interoperability issues as well as automating
   significant parts of the collaborative design process. In this paper,
   the development of an automated modelling system to facilitate
   integrated structural design and wind engineering analysis using BIM is
   presented. The research was focused on pre-engineered building (PEB) as
   a case study. This research introduces some novel BIM concepts to
   facilitate the implementation of automation in the model development
   processes. These concepts facilitate engineering analysis integration
   and overcome challenges associated with creating and working with
   different level of development (LOD) models. The proposed system uses a
   central element level database and outputs a 3D model of the building
   and the computational domain for use by the computational fluid dynamics
   software. A BIM-based application program interface (API) and
   stand-alone software was developed to evaluate the proposed concepts and
   process and their feasibility. The results suggest a successful
   integration that could significantly improve the building design quality
   and further facilitate wind, or other, engineering design
   collaborations. It is also observed that the resulting process could be
   applied (extended) to the general architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry.},

Journal = {GEODETSKI VESTNIK},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},
Pages = {594-613},
Abstract = {The use of point clouds in extracting data for building information
   modelling (BIM) has become common recently. Managers of older buildings
   are working to centralise information. Documentation about mechanical
   installations, plumbing, electricity, and previous interventions is
   often stored on scattered media, frequently still on paper. In the
   transformation of the material world into the digital world, the point
   cloud is the starting point, containing information about the material
   world obtained by various means such as photogrammetry, terrestrial or
   aerial laser scanning. Manual BIM modelling for management, maintenance
   and future use is a time-consuming and error-prone process. We would
   like to automate this process and avoid these errors. Recently, there
   have been developed an increasing number of stand-alone programmes and
   add-ons that provide automated, fast, and more accurate modelling based
   on point cloud data. In this paper we present an investigation into the
   possibilities for automating the creation of BIM models from point cloud
   data. The result is a semi-automated process for modelling individual
   BIM elements, which we have tested on specific examples of modelling
   individual elements (walls, pipes, and columns). We note that despite
   the automation of the process, a high level of user interaction is still
   required to produce good quality models.},

   (LCA) Using Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) File Format},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},

Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {In the realm of sustainable construction, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   plays a key role as a tool for quantifying the environmental impacts of
   building materials and products. The integration of LCA and Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) makes it possible to evaluate the
   environmental performance of buildings at the design stage. This
   integration can help to improve the LCA process for buildings thanks to
   the potential for automation and interoperability. The goal of this
   study is to establish a BIM-based LCA workflow using the Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC) open file format. The interoperability of BIM
   data exchange is achieved by applying IFC. The steps of the assessment
   process are described in accordance with the LCA phases outlined in the
   ISO 14040 standard. The impact assessment and results interpretation
   phases are automated by means of a program code for IFC file processing.
   The proposed BIM-based LCA is validated for a case study of a BIM model
   constructed for a three-story educational building. The GWP of the
   building materials and products of envelope and load-bearing structures
   at the A1-A3 life cycle stages are calculated for the purpose of
   proposed workflow testing. The resulting workflow allows for the
   calculation of negative environmental impacts to be agile, depending on
   the goal and scope set.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to systematically analyse how
   building information modelling (BIM) transforms complex infrastructure
   settings (i.e. airports) around digital technologies by enhancing
   connectivity and collaboration between major stakeholders and
   construction technology solutions. The objectives include understanding
   each project party's perspective for BIM implementation to align their
   motivations and connectivity along project's supply chain network and
   how BIM drives construction technology ecosystem uses for a more
   integrative and collaborative project delivery.
   Design/methodology/approach The study adopts qualitative data collection
   and analysis methods comprising semi-structured interviews, thematic
   analysis and an explanatory case study of a large-hub airport project.
   Findings The study findings show that enabling BIM implementation leads
   to streamlining construction technology ecosystem uses that increase
   connectivity within project parties' processes. Airports - as hosting
   high-value assets - can fast realize value of synergistic activities
   throughout project delivery by harnessing significant amount of siloed
   data created by each major party. Originality/value The study provides a
   structured analysis of how complex project settings leverage
   construction technology uses through their core BIM processes by
   highlighting multi-party approaches from an ecosystem perspective. This
   study also contributes to the body of knowledge and practice by
   presenting a transferrable and scalable approach for leveraging
   connected construction technology in a large-scale project involving
   fragmented processes managed by a large number of stakeholders.},

Title = {The Creation of Construction Schedules in 4D BIM: A Comparison of
   Conventional and Automated Approaches},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is now a globally recognised
   phenomenon, though its adoption remains inconsistent and variable
   between and within the construction sectors of different countries. BIM
   technology has enabled a wide range of functional applications, one of
   which, `4D BIM', involves linking the tasks in a project's construction
   schedule to its object-orientated 3D model to improve the logistical
   decision making and delivery of the project. Ideally, this can be
   automatically generated but in reality, this is not currently possible,
   and the process requires considerable manual effort. The level of
   maturity and expertise in the use of BIM amongst the project
   participants still varies considerably; adding further obstacles to the
   ability to derive full benefits from BIM. Reflecting these challenges,
   two case studies are presented in this paper. The first describes a
   predominantly manual approach that was used to ameliorate the
   implementation of 4D BIM on a project in Paris. In fact, there is scope
   for automating the process: a combination of BIM and Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) could exploit newly-available data that are
   increasingly obtainable from smart devices or IoT sensors. A
   prerequisite for doing so is the development of dedicated ontologies
   that enable the formalisation of the domain knowledge that is relevant
   to a particular project typology. Perhaps the most challenging example
   of this is the case of renovation projects. In the second case study,
   part of a large European research project, the authors propose such an
   ontology and demonstrate its application by developing a digital tool
   for application within the context of deep renovation projects.},

   developing countries in particular. To fill this gap, a closer
   assessment of current built-asset information management practice is
   necessary. The assessment of the practice examines how digital processes
   and/or technology can be seamlessly integrated into existing practices.
   In this regard, this study aims to provide valuable insights into
   increasing the maturity of builtasset information management by
   integrating digital data with BIM. The study uses a case-based research
   design using built-assets (universities in Addis Ababa) as public
   building representative to capture the prevailing information management
   practices in Ethiopian public buildings. The findings reveal that
   traditional paper-based practices still dominate the management of
   builtassets. This leads to difficulties in terms of data loss,
   unavailability, inaccuracy, and unreliability, all of which are
   detrimental to the overall performance. Based on these findings, a
   conceptual framework is designed to improve the performance of
   built-assets and help owners, end-users, and managers in defining data
   and information requirements for BIM-enabled asset information
   management. The framework delineates processes for structured
   information requirements definition and validation of various asset data
   from varying sources. The framework utilizes a BIM-enabled platform as a
   single source of truth and offers a comprehensive solution to the
   identified challenges. The findings of this study holds significant
   promise for improving the existing practice of built-asset information
   management within the study context.},

Title = {Semantic enrichment of building and city information models: A ten-year
   review},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Building Information Models (BIMs) and City Information Models (CIMs)
   have flourished in building and urban studies independently over the
   past decade. Semantic enrichment is an indispensable process that adds
   new semantics such as geometric, non-geometric, and topological
   information into existing BIMs or CIMs to enable multidisciplinary
   applications in fields such as construction management, geoinformatics,
   and urban planning. These two paths are now coming to a juncture for
   integration and juxtaposition. However, a critical review of the
   semantic enrichment of BIM and CIM is missing in the literature. This
   research aims to probe into semantic enrichment by comparing its
   similarities and differences between BIM and CIM over a ten-year time
   span. The research methods include establishing a uniform conceptual
   model, and sourcing and analyzing 44 pertinent cases in the literature.
   The findings plot the terminologies, methods, scopes, and trends for the
   semantic enrichment approaches in the two domains. With the increasing
   availability of data sources, algorithms, and computing power, they
   cross the border to enter each other's domain. Future research will
   likely gain new momentums from the demands of value-added applications,
   development of remote sensing devices, intelligent data processing
   algorithms, interoperability between BIM and CIM software platforms, and
   emerging technologies such as big data analytics.},

Title = {An Automatic Generation Method of Finite Element Model Based on BIM and
   Ontology},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {For the mechanical analysis work in the structural design phase, data
   conversion and information transfer between BIM model and finite element
   model have become the main factors limiting its efficiency and quality,
   with the development of BIM (building information modeling) technology
   application in the whole life cycle. The combined application of BIM and
   ontology technology has promoted the automation of compliance checking,
   cost management, green building evaluation, and many other fields. Based
   on OpenBIM, this study combines IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) and
   the ontology system and proposes an automatic generation method for
   converting BIM to the finite element model. Firstly, the elements
   contained in the finite element model are generalized and the
   information set requirement, to be extracted or inferred from BIM for
   the generation of the finite element model, is obtained accordingly.
   Secondly, the information extraction technical route is constructed to
   satisfy the acquisition of the information set, including three main
   aspects, i.e., IFC-based material information, spatial information, and
   other basic information; ontology-based finite element cell selection
   method; and APDL statement generation methods based on JAVA, C\#, etc.
   Finally, a complete technical route and a software architecture,
   designed for converting BIM to the finite element model, are derived. To
   assess the feasibility of the method, a simple structure is tested in
   this paper, and the result indicates that the automatic decision-making
   reasoning mechanism of constructing element type and meshing method can
   be explored by ontology and IFC. This study contributes to the body of
   knowledge by providing an efficient method for automatic generation of
   the BIM structure model and a reference for future applications using
   BIM in structural analysis.},

Title = {Key Assessment Criteria for Organizational BIM Capabilities: A
   Cross-Regional Study},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is an emerging process for managing
   the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a facility.
   While BIM has developed in diverse aspects, the lack of organizational
   BIM capabilities remains a barrier to its implementation across the
   global architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry.
   Accordingly, AEC organizations need to understand their organizational
   BIM capabilities and those of other organizations to realize the
   benefits of implementing BIM. This study examines the key criteria for
   assessing organizational BIM capabilities across two countries-Malaysia
   and Iran. For this purpose, the study compares the assessment criteria
   for BIM capabilities among the two countries based on the following
   elements: (1) criticality of the criteria; (2) degree of centrality of
   the criteria; and (3) underlying groups of the criteria. A systematic
   literature review of 26 articles and semi-structured interviews with BIM
   professionals provided nineteen criteria. A total of 121 and 126 BIM
   professionals evaluated the criticality of the criteria through a survey
   in Malaysia and Iran. The collected data were analyzed using the
   contextual disparities test (Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test,
   and rank agreement factor), network analysis, and exploratory factor
   analysis (EFA). The leading key criteria in both countries are ``the
   company has the necessary infrastructure to implement BIM{''}, ``the
   company has a good attitude towards new technology{''}, and ``the
   company understands its expertise{''}. However, the subsequent key
   criteria differ between countries. Furthermore, while the level of
   agreement on the ranking of the criteria is at a neutral level, the
   Mann-Whitney U test indicates that the level of criticality
   significantly differs between countries for most criteria. There are
   also changes in the level of criticality of the criteria between
   countries. Finally, criteria with a high degree of centrality differ
   between countries. On the contrary, although the criteria slightly
   differ between countries, the overarching groups of the criteria are
   similar (i.e., the criteria are related to organizational BIM
   capabilities and organizational capabilities). Understanding these
   criteria can help researchers and industry practitioners develop the
   optimal tool for assessing organizational BIM capabilities for the local
   industry.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {894-913},
Abstract = {Surveillance cameras are becoming an integral part of the buildings due
   to their ability to ensure security, as well as to promote safety and
   overall well-being. Finding the optimal camera configuration remains
   challenge, as current practices depend heavily on professional
   experience and subjective judgment. These practices have several
   limitations which can adversely impact camera coverage. Building
   information modelling (BIM) usage is growing in the industry due to its
   ability to generate accurate spatial data. Therefore, this study
   proposes a BIM-based framework to optimize camera placement process
   using optimization algorithms (OAs). Firstly, the framework extracts
   spatial data of the target area from the BIM based on user defined
   requirements. Secondly, it adopts an optimization algorithm to find the
   optimal camera positions for the target area based on user requirement.
   The selection of optimization algorithm was made following a comparative
   evaluation between Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO). Lastly, it helps visualize the optimized results
   within the building using BIM. The framework was validated on a hospital
   building, revealing 27\% increase coverage, a significant reduction in
   overlap, and a lower camera requirement compared to experience-based
   camera},

Abstract = {Current planning tools provide insufficient support for the scheduling

   Consequently, installation activities often deviate from project plans.
   However, BIM data on the spatial layout of Mechanical and Electrical

Abstract = {Purpose - The compliance checking of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   models is crucial throughout the lifecycle of construction. The
   increasing amount and complexity of information carried by BIM models
   have made compliance checking more challenging, and manual methods are
   prone to errors. Therefore, this study aims to propose an integrative
   conceptual framework for automated compliance checking of BIM models,
   allowing for the identification of errors within BIM models.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study first analyzed the typical
   building standards in the field of architecture and fire protection, and
   then the ontology of these elements is developed. Based on this, a
   building standard corpus is built, and deep learning models are trained
   to automatically label the building standard texts. The Neo4j is
   utilized for knowledge graph construction and storage, and a data
   extraction method based on the Dynamo is designed to obtain checking
   data files. After that, a matching algorithm is devised to express the
   logical rules of knowledge graph triples, resulting in automated
   compliance checking for BIM models.
   Findings - Case validation results showed that this theoretical
   framework can achieve the automatic construction of domain knowledge
   graphs and automatic checking of BIM model compliance. Compared with
   traditional methods, this method has a higher degree of automation and
   portability.
   Originality/value - This study introduces knowledge graphs and natural
   language processing technology into the field of BIM model checking and
   completes the automated process of constructing domain knowledge graphs
   and checking BIM model data. The validation of its functionality and
   usability through two case studies on a self-developed BIM checking
   platform.},

Title = {Barriers to BIM Implementation in Architecture, Construction, and
   Engineering Projects-The Polish Study},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {BIM (building information modeling) is a kind of technology that has
   great potential to enhance the level of automation in architecture,
   engineering, and construction (AEC) projects. The created virtual model
   of the facility allows coordinating all industries during the entire
   life cycle of the building. The possibility to save the data related to
   the given facility in one place, namely in the BIM model, enables
   control and management of the AEC projects at every stage. During the
   design and implementation phase, BIM models facilitate the optimization
   of time, costs, and quality, and in the operational phase, they support
   effective management of the facility. The use of BIM for building energy
   modeling (BEM) is the next step of evolution in architecture and
   engineering design practice. The benefits of using the BIM approach are
   widely discussed in the literature; however, they may be hard to achieve
   if appropriate attention is not directed to minimizing the barriers to
   the implementation of this technology. Observing Europe, one can notice
   that western and northern countries successfully use BIM for their
   needs, while the countries of the Eastern Bloc, including Poland,
   introduce it at a slower pace. In the present paper, the authors
   conducted a cause-and-effect analysis of the identified barriers to the
   implementation of BIM technology in the construction process. For this
   purpose, the authors applied the Ishikawa diagram, which is a tool that
   helps to recognize the actual or potential causes of failure. The
   analysis conducted showed that one of the weakest links in the
   successful BIM implementation is people and, in particular, their lack
   of knowledge and reluctance to change. The authors indicated the need to
   introduce and strengthen preventive actions, mainly through education:
   training, courses, and studies focused on BIM technology.},

Abstract = {The construction technology (CONTEC) method was originally developed for
   automated CONTEC planning and project management based on the data in
   the form of a budget or bill of quantities. This article outlines a new
   approach in an automated creation of the discrete nD building
   information modeling (BIM) models by using data from the BIM model and
   their processing by existing CONTEC method through the CONTEC software.
   This article outlines the discrete modeling approach on BIM models as
   one of the applicable approaches for nD modeling. It also defines the
   methodology of interlinking BIM model data and CONTEC software through
   the classification of items. The interlink enables automation in the
   production of discrete nD BIM model data, such as schedule (4D)
   including work distribution end resource planning, budget (5D)-based on
   integrated pricing system, but also nD data such as health and safety
   risks (6D) plans (H\&S Risk register), quality plans, and quality
   assurance checklists (7D) including their monitoring and environmental
   plans (8D). The methodology of the direct application of the selected
   classification system, as well as means of data transfer and conditions
   of data transferability, is described. The method was tested on the case
   study of an office building project, and acquired data were compared to
   actual construction time and costs. The case study proves the
   application of the CONTEC method as a usable method in the BIM model
   environment, enabling the creation of not only 4D, 5D models but also nD
   discrete models up to 8D models in the perception of the construction
   management process. In comparison with the existing BIM classification
   systems, further development of the method will enable full automated
   discrete nD model creation in the BIM model environment.},

Abstract = {Laser scanning 3D technology is gaining prominence in Architecture,
   Engineering and Construction, aiming to organize space and shape the
   human environment. Main advantages of laser scanning, such as
   efficiency, high accuracy and precision, low time consumption, safety,
   and non-invasiveness, provide technological support for sustainable
   development goals. Obtaining a point cloud using laser scanning and
   creating 3D models allows producing a highly detailed computer image of
   a measuring facility. The resulting spatial model of the building makes
   it possible to prepare inventory documentation, conduct construction
   analyses, and widely support technical facility management. The use of
   detailed data about a single building is becoming possible to enrich BIM
   (Building Information Modelling) or GEOBIM (geospatial environment with
   BIM). The present paper discusses the measurement and modelling of
   buildings using both terrestrial laser scanning. As an auxiliary method,
   close-range photogrammetry was carried out from an unmanned aerial
   vehicle. For this purpose, models were created of three facilities
   located in Poland. Particular attention was drawn to analysing potential
   errors in mapping. Direct geometry measurements were performed, and
   statistical analyses, deviations of actual lengths were specified. The
   results obtained have indicated that the measurement accuracy of
   existing buildings and its digital model is better than +/- 1 cm.},

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is increasingly appropriate for
   infrastructure projects, and in particular for transport infrastructure.
   It is a digital solution that integrates the practices of the
   construction industry in facility management during the whole life
   cycle. This integration is possible through a single tool, which is the
   3D digital model. Nevertheless, BIM standards, such as industry
   foundation classes, are still in the pipeline for infrastructure
   management. These standards do not fully meet the requirements of
   operation and maintenance of transport infrastructure. This paper shows
   how BIM could be implemented to address issues related to the operation
   and maintenance phase for transport infrastructure management. For this
   purpose, a new ontological approach, called Industry Foundation Classes
   for Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructures (IFCInfra4OM), is
   detailed. This ontology aims to standardise the use of building
   information modelling for operation and maintenance in road
   infrastructures. To highlight the interest of the proposed ontological
   approach, a building information model of a section on the A7
   Agadir-Marrakech Highway in Morocco is produced according to
   IFCInfra4OM. The methodology is presented. The results obtained,
   including the IFCInfra4OM data model, are submitted. In the last
   section, an overview of the IFC extension approach is submitted.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Underground utilities are important assets that provide basic services
   for society's daily life. They are generally very complex and remain
   unnoticed until they fail due to any particular reason. The stakeholders
   involved in the design, construction, and maintenance of utility
   infrastructure face many problems due to the traditional underground
   utility management system, resulting in injuries, loss of life,
   disruptions, project delays, and financial loss. The problem with the
   traditional system is that it uses 2D drawings and keeps unreliable
   information or a lack of updated information, which makes it an
   inefficient utility management system. With the advancement in
   construction information technology, we can address this effectively by
   integrating BIM and GIS. In this paper, a novel integrated BIM-GIS
   framework for underground utility management systems was developed on
   the basis of IFC to CityGML mapping. It provides an effective
   underground utility management system that facilitates designers in
   optimization of the design, assists in the excavator's operator by
   providing real-time three-dimensional spatial information during the
   construction process, and acts as an as-built information database for
   utility facility management. For validation, a real-time project case
   study indicated that the proposed system can effectively provide
   comprehensive underground utility information at different project
   stages.},

Title = {Development of a BIM-based holonic system for real-time monitoring of
   building operational efficiency},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {89-103},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the wide context of facility management, several processes, such as
   operations, maintenance, retrofitting, and renovations, ensure that
   buildings comply with the principles of efficiency, cost-effectiveness,
   and indoor comfort. Apart from ordinary operation, facility management
   is responsible for the renovation of and long-term performance
   improvement of building facilities. In such a scenario, the
   cyber-physical system (CPS) paradigm with holonic architecture, which is
   the focus of this study, can successfully guide the operation management
   and long-term refurbishment processes of buildings. Analogous to the
   manufacturing field, the developed CPS maximizes holons'
   self-configuration and self-organization and overall throughput
   effectiveness metrics to detect the best corrective actions toward
   system improvements. Consequently, suggestions and lessons learned from
   the evaluation of building efficiency are redirected to the building
   information model. Hence, the digital model acts as a repository of
   currently available equipment for operations management and the history
   of diagnoses that support decision-making during the maintenance,
   retrofitting, and renovation processes. Evidently, the repeated
   detection of a specific issue, which is unaffected by operations
   management, should be considered an opportunity to act and enhance the
   performances of existing building components. Similar to a
   goods-producing industry, the building management system developed in
   this study applies the aforementioned methodology to provide services
   related to indoor comfort and building health. This approach indicates
   that a method for automatic real-time diagnosis is tested in a case
   study consisting of a multi-use and large public building. The current
   paper, which is an extended version of the one presented in the Creative
   Construction Conference 2018, deepens the decision support tool and the
   supervision policy. Moreover, the developed system is contextualized by
   providing an example of use case and highlighting the step forward in
   the field of smart buildings.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Although a considerable amount of research has addressed the use of
   building information modelling (BIM) in facilities management (FM)
   within the past years, there is limited systematic review on
   investigating the potentials of BIM within the operation and maintenance
   (O\&M) life cycle phase. Yet, this phase could account for approximately
   60\% of the total life cycle costs of assets. The purpose of this paper
   is to conduct a systematic literature review on the application of BIM
   in the O\&M phase to identify current research trends, research gaps and
   future directions. This study achieves the aforementioned purpose by
   adopting the preferred reporting items for systematic review and
   meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P). It employs qualitative and
   quantitative techniques to analyse the articles from a combination of
   three multi-disciplinary research databases, namely-Scopus, Web of
   Science and Engineering Village, which also comprises Compendex, InSpec,
   GeoRef and GeoBase sub-databases. After an in-depth review of 196
   selected journal articles, this study systemically presents: (1)
   bibliometric analyses of the literature in BIM and O \& M; (2) research
   patterns and trends; (3) drivers and barriers to BIM-O\&M integration;
   and (4) research gaps mapped into a standard project management
   lifecycle to guide future research directions. The content analysis
   reveals that BIM has mainly been integrated under seven functions:
   information management (IM), advanced technology (AT), maintenance and
   asset management (MAM), indoor management (IM), performance assessment
   (PA), visualisation (V), and lean management (LM). Findings of the study
   reveal that the UK, USA and China are the top ranked countries with
   regards to research outputs on BIM-O\&M integrations. The majority of
   BIM integrations within O\&M falls under the information management
   function, whereas the least research output was recorded under lean
   management. In addition, the majority of studies focused on
   institutional and infrastructure facility types, but residential,
   industrial and commercial buildings were underrepresented, despite their
   disproportionate physical dominance within most societies. Findings also
   show that potential drivers and barriers for BIM integrations within
   O\&M can be classified into three main categories-technical,
   organisational, and legal/contractual. It is then concluded that the
   application of BIM within O\&M is still emerging, which further
   emphasises the need for more studies that address value realization in
   the context of BIM in O\&M, with particular focus on the specific O\&M
   principles for different building types.},

Abstract = {The use of BIM-based Model Checking (BMC) has the potential to improve
   building design processes by enabling the automation of building
   assessments. However, only a few BMC systems are being used in the
   building design practices. The limited use has been identified to be
   related to socio-technical challenges that have so far not received much
   attention in research regarding BMC systems. To explore these
   challenges, a Design Science Research methodology was used to design a
   BMC prototype to improve the socio-technical challenges of BMC systems,
   specifically challenges of transparency and flexibility. The prototype
   was tested with practitioners to investigate aspects of BMC systems that
   potentially hinder its use. The results were used to discuss the
   potential for more practical application of BMC systems in design
   practices to obtain the benefits of providing a faster, more consistent,
   and more precise assessment of buildings.},

Abstract = {Heavy industrial construction, particularly when modularization is
   adopted, requires thorough heavy-lift studies to manage the extensive
   use of mobile cranes in congested and dynamic site layouts. This study
   introduces an integrated 4D crane simulation and onsite operation
   management framework for multiple concurrent mobile crane operations in
   the BIM environment with the support of a comprehensive database. Unlike
   similar recent efforts, the proposed framework is built upon previously
   developed crane planning and optimization systems, which enables
   generating accurate operation plans both in micro (objects) and macro
   scales (site). This framework addresses five different components
   regarding onsite crane operation management, including BIMbased
   multi-crane lift animation, scheduling and cost analyses, motion
   controlling in the BIM environment, safety monitoring and clash
   detection, and spatiotemporal site analyses. The developed framework's
   functionality is validated by implementing it into a portion of a real
   project in Alberta, Canada, through three different cases.},

Title = {Enhancing the MEP Coordination Process with BIM Technology and
   Management Strategies},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been increasingly used in
   coordinating the different mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP)
   services in the construction industries. As the construction industries
   are slowly adapting to BIM, the use of 2D software may become obsolete
   in the future as MEP services are technically more complicated to
   coordinate, due to respective services' codes of practice to follow and
   limit ceiling height. The 3D MEP designs are easy to visualize before
   installing the respective MEP services on the construction site to
   prevent delay in the construction process. The aid of current advanced
   technology has brought BIM to the next level to reduce manual work
   through automation. Combining both innovative technology and suitable
   management methods not only improves the workflow in design
   coordination, but also decreases conflict on the construction site and
   lowers labor costs. Therefore, this paper tries to explore possible
   advance technology in BIM and management strategies that could help MEP
   services to increase productivity, accuracy, and efficiency with a lower
   cost of finalizing the design of the building. This will assist the
   contractors to complete construction works before the targeted schedule
   and meet the client's expectations.},

Title = {Version control for asynchronous BIM collaboration: Model merging
   through graph analysis and transformation},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {155},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The design process in construction projects is iterative and
   multi-disciplinary in nature. In today's industry practice, several
   discipline experts concurrently author multiple versions and design
   variants of BIM models and share them at frequent intervals. Applying a
   sound version control methodology can significantly enhance automation,
   enabling the coordination and combination of these model versions into
   consistent overall models with less extensive manual effort. This paper
   introduces a diff-and-patch mechanism for transferring changes between
   model versions, facilitating object-level change tracking using graph
   representations of BIM model data, and specifically focuses on merging
   diverging versions through the application of graph transformations. The
   mechanisms for executing branching and merging of model versions are
   thoroughly explained and showcased through various illustrative
   scenarios. The presented method adheres to the established principles of
   federated BIM collaboration but equips the participating parties with
   additional means to automate the combination of various model versions,
   allowing them to focus on the relevant conflicts. The proposed
   methodology of graph-based version control unlocks the potential of
   analyzing interdisciplinary dependencies across partial models and
   enables the more efficient resolution of conflicting model versions.},

Abstract = {By the 2010s, BIM is highly popular research area that gathers
   researchers from various domains. We tackle the major challenge of BIM
   and the main barrier for the application of BIM in smart environments:
   integration of BIM and wireless sensor networks. Existing studies in the
   literature have various dependencies and propose limited solutions.
   These solutions are dedicated to specific applications and domains.
   However, it is highly required to have a generic solution for real time
   indoor and outdoor environmental monitoring with full integration with
   the digital model of the building. To fulfill this need, in this study,
   we propose a novel approach to monitor and fulfill user requirements by
   a numerical model of the building, a novel framework and a BIMWSN
   integrated architecture based on the BIM principles for smart building
   environments. All the experiments are performed on a real testbed,
   physical sensor devices deployed on the classrooms of the university
   building. Such numerical model presents the digital model of the
   environment by gathering acquired data. Besides, data is gathered on a

Title = {ANALYSIS OF 5D BIM FOR COST ESTIMATION, COST CONTROL, AND PAYMENTS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Pages = {525-548},
Abstract = {Increasing expectancy for efficiency in the delivery of building
   projects and the adoption of lean production processes for construction
   has made the necessity for the development of an integrated system for
   cost estimating, cost monitoring, cost control, and payments in the
   construction lifecycle important. Existing 5D BIM tools are used to
   estimate the cost of projects during the preconstruction period. There
   is a lack of integration between the 5D BIM models, existing progress
   monitoring tools, and payment systems used in construction. Lack of
   standardization in the use of model elements through the project
   lifecycle has also been identified as one of the factors limiting
   automation in 5D BIM. Construction project monitoring can be automated
   by combining modern technologies that allow for visualization of
   building progress (Laser scanners, computer vision) with 5D BIM cost
   estimation tools. These project monitoring tools can be combined with
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Smart contracts to develop an
   integrated lifecycle system for cost management in construction. This
   paper examines existing systems used in 5D BIM to develop integrated
   practices and systems that will streamline the process of cost
   estimating, cost monitoring, cost control, and cash flow in the
   construction supply chain. This will reduce the inefficiency that exists
   today with traditional contracts and payment applications that do not
   interact with the 5D BIM application. By leveraging a standardized
   classification ID system throughout a project life cycle and applying AI
   and smart contract, features like cost estimation cost control, and
   payments can be fully streamlined, integrated, and automated. A case
   study of an existing construction project utilizing 5D BIM was examined.
   According to the study, 5D BIM is used in the pre-construction stage of
   a cost estimation project. It was also revealed that 5D BIM improves
   project cost visualization and budget control.},

Title = {Greening existing buildings through Building Information Modelling: A
   review of the recent development},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {200},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for green retrofitting
   is a recent development due to its integrated solutions for evaluating
   and monitoring the environmental sustainability performance of existing
   buildings. It can be implemented throughout different stages of building
   life cycle using centralized digital models. However, the actual
   applications of such technology are still scarce and require further
   study and verification. In this paper, a systematic review of the recent
   development of BIM was conducted on two related areas: (a) existing
   buildings' sustainability performance and (b) green retrofitting. The
   review highlights that little work has been conducted on these two areas
   concurrently which is mainly at the exploration stage. The results
   further reveal common BIM sustainability tools, performance parameters
   and design parameters in the recent research on the green retrofitting
   of existing buildings. Furthermore, a research framework has been
   developed to fill the research gaps and future needs in the
   implementation of BIM for green retrofitting, including data acquisition
   techniques, integrated process, unified platform, data interoperability
   and management, level of automation, design alteration as well as auto
   data feedback. This paper provides new insights into both theoretical
   developments and practical or technical aspects of BIM in fostering a
   complete green retrofit ecosystem.},

Title = {Fire risk assessment for building operation and maintenance based on BIM
   technology},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {205},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Building fires are the most common types of fires, and most fires occur
   during the operation and maintenance periods of buildings. A majority of
   the risk factors causing fire are inextricably linked to human life,
   which can only be controlled but not eliminated. Fire risk assessment is
   necessary to control fire risk and improve the preventive ability. The
   assessment method established in this study can scientifically calculate
   the fire risk value by quantifying the fire risk index of buildings.
   Combined with BIM technology, this method can quickly and reliably
   assess the fire risk of the target building model and realise the
   organic unity of science, effectiveness and economy. Based on the fire
   risk analysis method for engineering (FRAME), we propose an assessment
   index system for buildings in the operation and maintenance periods in
   terms of the potential risk level, acceptable risk level and protection
   level. In addition, a risk value calculation model for the operation and
   maintenance periods is established, and the risk value assessment
   standard is set to improve the firefighting ability of buildings.
   Furthermore, the assessment indexes are incorporated into the family
   attributes in Revit software to realise the information interaction
   between the assessment system and the model. The results show that BIM
   technology can be applied effectively to fire safety, to ensure that the
   fire risk prevention and control ability of the target has a more
   intuitive scientific basis. It also provides a direction and ideas for
   the development and application of BIM technology.},

Title = {Bibliometric analysis of building information modeling, geographic
   information systems and web environment integration},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {128},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS) within the Web environment is a promising
   approach that greatly enhances the capabilities of the aforementioned
   environments through the wide range of technology solutions used on the
   Web. This paper aims to reveal the trends of research in BIM, GIS, and
   Web integration and discuss the challenges and potential opportunities
   of such integration in terms of the most common uses in construction.
   The bibliometric analysis used as the method, compared to conventional
   literature reviews, reduces the likelihood of subjective judgments. The
   methodology used is based on a set of five research questions. To answer
   these, bibliographic coupling is used to analyze the publications
   datasets, specifically, co-citation networks, co-authorship networks,
   and the co-occurrence map of keywords. This review contributes to the
   field in raising awareness of the knowledge composition of BIM, GIS, and
   Web integration in the last decade, dominant research topics, the most
   recent trends, and the most pressing issues and use cases analyzed in
   the current studies related to BIM, GIS, and Web integration, thus
   identifying gaps and defining future research areas on the topic. The
   research shows that the number of developments focusing on BIM, GIS and
   Web integration has been continuously growing with a sudden increase
   after 2016. The study also revealed that the research work in this area
   consists of disjointed and fragmented research studies and has been
   conducted mainly in isolated clusters. Gaps and critical areas for
   future research include BIM, GIS, and Web interoperability solutions,
   standardization, BIM model processing and performance optimization, data
   exchange and storage.},

Title = {BIM-based search and selection of construction material suppliers: a
   dedicated framework and prototype},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 13},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to address the key issues concerning supplier
   selection in traditional construction procurement by proposing an
   innovative, novel, state-of-the-art prototype plugin building
   information modelling - supplier search and ranking (BIM-SSR) and an
   associated conceptual framework. It enhances building information
   modelling (BIM) capabilities through web crawling and analytical
   hierarchy processes (AHP). It uses the World Wide Web to procure
   construction material suppliers. Design/methodology/approach - Prevalent
   issues in traditional procurement of material suppliers have been
   identified through a rigorous literature review. Field experts vetted
   these issues. A framework has been presented to address these issues
   based on integrated web crawling and AHP as a multi-criteria decision-
   making (MCDM) method. A BIM prototype (BIM-SSR) has been developed using
   Python and plugged into Autodesk Revit to automate the search and
   evaluation of material suppliers based on precise material
   specifications from the BIM design. The BIM-SSR prototype is tested
   through a case study and validated by field professionals for its
   efficiency in tackling the identified issues. Findings - Thirteen key
   issues have been identified concerning traditional construction
   procurement pertinent to supplier selection. Best-value procurement was
   encouraged by identifying supplier selection criteria such as cost,
   delivery time, experience, compliance with quality management standards,
   warranties, and claim period. The presented BIM-SSR prototype has an
   efficiency of 80\%-95\% in addressing the issues identified in this
   study and 97.5\% effectiveness in improving the overall procurement
   management process. Originality/value - The BIM-SSR prototype developed
   in this study is a novel and innovative addition to the body of
   knowledge that has been integrated into Autodesk Revit as a Plugin.
   Automation of supplier search and selection through digital
   technologies, including web crawling and integration of traditionally
   accepted MCDM methods such as AHP in BIM, is another innovation in the
   current study. Overall, this study presents a holistic, innovative
   system, from conceptual design to practical implementation and
   demonstration. This is one of the steps to help the traditional
   construction procurement process evolve into a more modern and digital
   procurement.},

Abstract = {According to sustainable development goals, the construction industry is
   one of the vital industries that can build resilient and sustainable
   infrastructure for human settlements. As the traditional approaches in
   the construction industry are causing distinct challenges including
   environmental pollution and excess energy usage, however, the
   integration of emerging technologies will assist us to reduce the impact
   and also enhance the activities in the construction industry. Motivated
   by the facts, this study aims to address the significance of automation
   in the construction industry with distinct emerging technologies like
   the Internet of things (IoT), automation, radio frequency identification
   (RFID), building information modeling (BIM), augmented reality (AR), and
   virtual reality (VR). The large amount of data generated from the IoT,
   RFID, BIM, and AR/VR provided an opportunity for big data and artificial
   intelligence (AI) to extract meaningful insights related to the events
   in the construction industry. Furthermore, edge and fog computing
   technology encourages us to implement AI at the edge network for
   analytics at the end of the edge device. Based on the above analysis,
   the article discussed recommendations that could assist in further
   enhancement and implementation of automation in the construction
   industry. Cloud-assisted AR/VR, integration of AI with IoT
   infrastructure, 4D printing, adopting blockchain in the construction
   industry, and smart robotics are the recommendation addressed in this
   article.},

Abstract = {The construction industry is undergoing a significant transformation
   driven by advancements in Building Information Modelling (BIM) and
   robotics, which are key elements of the Fourth and Fifth Industrial
   Revolutions. While BIM facilitates collaborative information management
   throughout a building's lifecycle, robotics introduces automation and
   precision in construction tasks. The integration of BIM-robotics has the
   potential to enhance safety, productivity and efficiency in
   construction. However, the adoption of BIM-robotics remains
   underexplored in Malaysia. This study aims to evaluate the challenges of
   implementing BIM robotics in the Malaysian construction industry. A
   total of 22 secondary data sources were collected from a comprehensive
   literature review. A questionnaire survey was adopted for primary data
   collection. For data analysis, four statistical tests were conducted
   which are exploratory factor analysis (EFA), descriptive analysis,
   reliability analysis and correlation analysis. The main findings
   identified four key factors from the EFA, such as technological,
   organisational, environmental and financial. Descriptive analysis
   revealed the critical challenge within each factor, while reliability
   analysis confirmed strong internal consistency. All identified
   challenges were found to be positively correlated. By identifying the
   challenges to BIM-robotics adoption, this study provides valuable
   insights for policymakers, industry practitioners and researchers to
   create plans for overcoming these challenges. Ultimately, this study
   contributes to advancing the construction industry's readiness for
   technological integration, aligning with national goals for Construction
   4.0 and beyond.},

Title = {A Conceptual Framework for BIM-Based Site Safety Practice},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With developments in Industry 4.0, there is growing momentum to adopt
   technology-assisted tools to support existing processes. Even though
   most construction processes are now computerized, safety procedures have
   not yet fully embraced the digital revolution. Building information
   modeling (BIM) is a platform that radically redefines the way in which
   businesses operate. Various past studies on the application of BIM in
   site safety mainly focus on using BIM for safety during construction and
   for a specific project type. The potential benefits of BIM for site
   safety have not yet been fully explored. The aim of the present study is
   to develop a BIM-based automatic safety checking (ASC) framework for an
   early identification of hazards. It includes safety checking with
   codified OSHA rules, corrective actions, scheduling, and reporting in a
   virtual environment. All these steps are part of the risk lifecycle
   which is typically managed according to the phases of construction on a
   physical site. However, in the proposed framework, all these steps are
   managed at the preconstruction stage in a virtual environment. The major
   contribution of this study is the proposed framework that provides the
   conceptual foundation for early site safety management by identifying
   hazards at the design stage. The integration of a 3D model with codified
   OSHA standard safety rules ensures that the design is in adherence to
   safety rules and is rendered hazard-free for a pilot case.},

Abstract = {Construction site layout planning (CSLP) is a typical problem in
   construction site management that urgently needs to be solved. A
   reasonable construction site layout can improve efficiency and reduce
   costs and unnecessary loss of time. To solve the CSLP problem, some
   emerging optimization algorithms and enhanced mathematical models have
   been developed. The building information model (BIM) provides data
   support for the implementation of previous research. However, manually
   extracting and modifying parameters from the BIM for use in optimization
   algorithms is cumbersome in practical applications, wasting considerable
   time and human resources. In this paper, we propose a framework of
   automated prefabricated building CSLP to realize the integration of the
   BIM and an optimization algorithm, which utilizes the Dynamo visual
   programming platform to create an information channel between the BIM
   and the optimization algorithm. A typical and practical case, which is
   optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization
   (PSO), is demonstrated to validate the proposed approach and to show an
   effective reduction in material transportation cost and unnecessary loss
   of time.},

Title = {Quantitative investigation on the accuracy and precision of Scan-to-BIM
   under different modelling scenarios},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Accurate as-built information is required to operate, maintain, and
   adapt existing buildings. Scan-to-BIM has become a feasible approach for
   collecting and modelling 3D as-built information and has three phases:
   (1) scanning, (2) registration, and (3) modelling. This paper focuses on
   the modelling phase, which can currently be conducted either manually or
   semi-automatically. As-built conditions of a building are surveyed, and
   the geometry is modeled in a series of modelling scenarios. For each
   trial, geometric dimensions of the BIMs are compared to ground truth
   dimensions. This paper assesses the impact of levels of automation and
   modeller training on the accuracy and precision of generated BIMs.
   Quantitative models are developed for modelling scenarios using
   empirical datasets. Lastly, the impacts of degrees of accuracy are
   discussed. This study provides insight into the dimensional certainty of
   BIMs generated by Scan-to-BIM and helps decision-makers assess the risk
   of decisions made based on this information.},

Abstract = {Facility management is an essential part of the building which
   encompasses multiple service areas and processes to ensuring optimum
   functionality of the facility. Digital twin (DT) has been increasingly
   introduced to the FM domain to facilitate FM tasks such as
   decision-making. Despite the advancements in DT-enabled FM, there still
   exists a problem in the disconnections between DT academics and FM
   practitioners. The emergence of knowledge management can act as a bridge
   between academics and FM practitioners. To mine knowledge in the
   DT-enabled FM industry for a better communication between different
   stakeholders and timely decisions in the case of emergency, this study
   proposes a natural language processing (NLP)-based approach. A detailed
   classification of FM-related entities is first presented, which divides
   the FM into five categories. The NLP model is used to extract entities
   and knowledge from a large volume of text data. The results indicate
   that an NLP-based approach can accurately extract FM-related knowledge.
   The findings of this study not only provide a basis for automatic
   DT-enabled FM-related knowledge extraction but also support the
   downstream tasks such as knowledge graph construction and FM-related
   emergency decision-making.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In recent years, facility management (FM) has adopted many computer
   technology solutions for building maintenance, such as building
   information modelling (BIM) and computerized maintenance management
   systems (CMMS). However, maintenance requests management in buildings
   remains a manual and a time-consuming process that depends on human
   management. In this paper, a machine-learning algorithm based on natural
   language processing (NLP) is proposed to classify maintenance requests.
   This algorithm aims to assist the FM teams in managing day-to-day
   maintenance activities. A healthcare facility is addressed as a case
   study in this work. Ten-year maintenance records from the facility
   contributed to the design and development of the algorithm. Multiple NLP
   methods were used in this study, and the results reveal that the NLP
   model can classify work requests with an average accuracy of 78\%.
   Furthermore, NLP methods have proven to be effective for managing
   unstructured text data.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {31},

Pages = {4897-4919},

Abstract = {PurposeThis research aims to argue that manual geometric modeling is
   blocking the building information modeling (BIM) promotion to small-size
   companies. Therefore, it is necessary to study a manner of automated
   modeling to reduce the dependence of BIM implementation on manpower.
   This paper aims to make a study into such a system to propose both its
   theory and prototype.Design/methodology/approachThis research took a
   prototyping as the methodology, which consists of three steps: (1)
   proposing a theoretical framework supporting automated geometric
   modeling process; (2) developing a prototype system based on the
   framework; (3) conducting a testing for the prototype system on its
   performance.FindingsPrevious researches into automated geometric
   modeling only respectively focused on a specific procedure for a
   particular engineering domain. No general model was abstracted to
   support generic geometric modeling. This paper, taking higher level of
   abstraction, proposed such a model that can describe general geometric
   modeling process to serve generic automated geometric modeling
   systems.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper focused on only
   geometric modeling, skipping non-geometric information of BIM. A
   complete BIM model consists of geometric and non-geometric data.
   Therefore, the method of combination of them is on the research
   agenda.Originality/valueThe model proposed by this paper provide a
   mechanism to translate engineering geometric objects into textual
   representations, being able to act as the kernel of generic automated
   geometric modeling systems, which are expected to boost BIM promotion in
   industry.},

Abstract = {This article discusses a BIM Quality Control Ecosystem that is based on
   Requirement Linked Data in order to create a framework where automated
   BIM compliance checking methods can be widely used. The meaning of
   requirements is analyzed in a building project context as a basis for
   data flow analysis: what are the main types of requirements, how they
   are handled, and what sources they originate from. A literature review
   has been conducted to find the present development directions in quality
   checking, besides a market research on present, already widely used
   solutions. With the conclusions of these research and modern data
   management theory, the principles of a holistic approach have been
   defined for quality checking in the Architecture, Engineering and
   Construction (AEC) industry. A comparative analysis has been made on
   current BIM compliance checking solutions according to our review
   principles. Based on current practice and ongoing research, a
   state-of-the-art BIM quality control ecosystem is proposed that is open,
   enables automation, promotes interoperability, and leaves the data
   governing responsibility at the sources of the requirements. In order to
   facilitate the flow of requirement and quality data, we propose a model
   for requirements as Linked Data and provide example for quality checking
   using Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL). As a result, an opportunity is
   given for better quality and cheaper BIM design methods to be
   implemented in the industry.},

Title = {Codification Challenges for Data Science in Construction},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {New forms of data science, including machine learning and data
   analytics, are enabled by machine-readable information but are not
   widely deployed in construction. A qualitative study of information flow
   in three projects using building information modeling (BIM) in the late
   design and construction phase is used to identify the challenges of
   codification that limit the application of data science. Despite
   substantial efforts to codify information with common data environment
   (CDE) platforms to structure and transfer digital information within and
   between teams, participants work across multiple media in both
   structured and unstructured ways. Challenges of codification identified
   in this paper relate to software usage (interoperability, information
   loss during conversion, multiple modelling techniques), information
   sharing (unstructured information sharing, drawing and file based
   sharing, document control bottlenecks, lack of process change), and
   construction process information (loss of constraints and low level of
   detail). This paper contributes to the current understanding of data
   science in construction by articulating the codification challenges and
   their implications for data quality dimensions, such as accuracy,
   completeness, accessibility, consistency, timeliness, and provenance. It
   concludes with practical implications for developing and using
   machine-readable information and directions for research to extract
   insight from data and support future automation.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The integration of automation technologies has improved the efficiency
   of industrialised construction (IC), yet a deeper understanding of their
   effects on the manufacturing and assembly stages remains necessary. This
   paper provides a systematic review of how various automation
   technologies influence these key stages in IC, analysing 53 articles. It
   explores the deployment of 22 technologies, including the Internet of

   seven benefits for IC: (1) interoperability, (2) scheduling
   optimisation, (3) production traceability, (4) production safety, (5)
   manufacturability, (6) quality assurance, and (7) constructability. To
   further advance automation in IC, future research should address
   critical challenges, including enhancing data quality, expanding
   empirical testing, exploring emerging technologies in depth, and
   integrating fragmented workflows. This article underscores the need of

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) represents significant progress in
   the field of digitalization and informatization of the construction
   process. The virtual model (BIM model) is the source of graphic data
   among other information, which are applicable for geometry verification
   of the building's structures. For this purpose, data and information
   about the building should be collected. Comparison of the BIM model
   (design) with as-built 3D models enables the evaluation of the quality
   of the as-built structures. The most effective methods for spatial data
   collection are terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and close-range
   photogrammetry. Using both methods, measurement can result in a point
   cloud. The paper describes an approach for verifying the geometry of
   wall structures. The graphic data of designed structures are represented
   by the existing BIM model. The approach presented uses the Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC) file format from which the designed geometry is
   derived. The as-built models of the structures are created from point
   clouds. Point cloud segmentation uses a combination of regression,
   filtering based on local normal vectors, and curve segmentation.
   Consequently, the designed and the as-built models (segmented from the
   point cloud) are compared.},

Title = {TunGPR: Enhancing data-driven maintenance for tunnel linings through
   synthetic datasets, deep learning and BIM},
Journal = {TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {145},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Non-destructive Testing (NDT) techniques and data -driven technologies
   are increasingly applied in underground infrastructure maintenance,
   which can facilitate predictive monitoring for informed decision
   -making. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is extensively utilised in rapid
   condition assessment of tunnel linings, particularly for detecting
   defects that lead to unforeseen changes of dielectric properties of
   materials. In this paper, a prototyped framework is proposed, namely
   TunGPR, for GPR-based tunnel lining assessment by incorporating Building
   Information Modelling (BIM), synthetic database and deep learning
   -enabled interpretation. The first module integrates laser -scanned
   point clouds and GPR Scan -to -BIM of tunnel lining with geological
   model. Subsequently, interoperability is achieved between the
   geo-integrated BIM and GPR simulation software. From the dielectric
   model retrieved from the BIM model, a database is established,
   considering a variety of condition combinations (i.e., voids, cavities,
   delamination, and water intrusion) leveraging domain randomisation and
   Finite -Difference Time -Domain (FDTD) modelling, as well as monitored
   field data. The dataset is then fed into the diagnostic module
   underpinned by a dual -rotational Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   that is customised to enhance accuracy and automation of hyperbola
   detection. Lastly, a preliminary risk assessment matrix is implemented
   into the BIM model for data management and action prioritisation. These
   efforts serve as an initial step to validate the feasibility and
   effectiveness of the GPR-enabled data -driven maintenance for tunnel
   linings in a BIMcentred framework.},

Abstract = {Featured Application To improve the integrated management in building
   conservation and encourage the AECO sector actors to adopt preventive
   maintenance in the field of cultural heritage. Currently, there is
   extensive research focused on automatic strategies for the segmentation
   and classification of 3D point clouds, which can accelerate the study of
   a landmark and integrate it with heterogeneous data and attributes,
   useful to facilitate the digital management of architectural heritage
   data. In this work, an automated image-based survey has been exploited a
   Region- Based Convolutional Neural Network. The training phase has been
   executed providing examples of images with the anomalies to be detected.
   At the same time, a laser scanning process was conducted to obtain a
   point cloud, which acts as a reference for the BIM process. In a final
   step, a process of projecting information from the images onto the BIM
   recreates the pathology shapes on the model's objects, which generates a
   decision support system for the built environment. The innovation of
   this research concerns the development of a workflow in which it is
   possible to automatize the recognition and classification of defects in
   historical buildings, to finally interpolate this geometric and
   numerical information with a BIM methodology, obtaining a representation
   and quantification of the information adapted to the facility management
   process. The use of innovative techniques such as artificial
   intelligence algorithms and different plug-ins becomes the main strength
   of this project.},

Title = {A PARAMETRIC APPROACH TOWARDS SEMI-AUTOMATED 3D AS-BUILT MODELING},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {806-825},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been developed in response to
   the growing complexity of construction projects. BIM implementation is
   beneficial throughout the entire building life cycle, and thus has been
   widely adopted in new projects. However, BIM implementation in existing
   buildings is impeded by the lack of as -built models. Conventionally,
   three-dimensional (3D) as-built BIMs are generated by experienced
   modelers, which is time-consuming and error-prone. To cater to the need,
   Scan-to-BIM is a solution for automation in as-built BIM generation. In
   the context of automated Scan-to-BIM, the parametric modeling process is
   worth investigating as it has the ability to not only reconstruct 3D
   objects from a variety of categories from point clouds but also offer
   flexibility to update objects simply by changing the values of the
   correlative parameters. Hence, this study proposes a semi-automated
   framework for assisting 3D as-built modeling through a parametric
   modeling approach. The presented methodology starts with wall boundary
   parameter extraction through 3D to 2D projection of the wall segments
   and line detection techniques, followed by retrieving geometric
   parameters of all other non-wall elements via CloudCompare. The
   extracted parameters are structured into a Microsoft (R) Excel (R) file
   and fed into Autodesk (R) Dynamo for 3D BIM creation using a series of
   designed logic. To substantiate the viability, the proposed framework is
   employed in two datasets containing structural, architectural,
   furniture, mechanical, and plumbing objects (further categorized into
   structural, hosted and non-hosted elements). The Intersection over Union
   (IoU) of structural elements was 96.35\%, while the root-mean-square
   error (RMSE) of hosted and non-hosted elements was 3.634 and 2.607 mm,
   respectively. This study established a universal methodology for
   semi-automated 3D as -built modeling that can guide future research.},

Title = {Automatic inspection data collection of building surface based on BIM
   and UAV},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {131},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Conventional high-rise building surface inspection is usually
   inefficient and requires the inspectors to work at heights with high
   risk. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) carrying optical or thermal
   cameras are currently widely utilized as an effective tool for
   inspection. The UAV-based data collection, especially for unreachable
   inspection areas, is the basis of unmanned inspection of building
   surface. In addition, building information modeling (BIM) with rich
   geometric and semantic information can also be instrumental in building
   surface in-spection. Therefore, this paper presented an automatic
   inspection method of building surface, especially for the inspection
   data collection, by integrating UAV and BIM. To minimize the length of
   UAV flight while collecting complete and high-quality image data
   considering the limited endurance capability, the coverage path planning
   problem is solved using genetic algorithm (GA). The required inspection
   areas are obtained from the BIM model of the target building to be
   inspected. To further enhance the automation of building surface
   inspection, the optimized UAV flight mission parameters are rapidly
   calculated based on the BIM model and proposed algorithm. A real office
   building in Shenzhen University campus is used to validate the presented
   automatic method. The quality of the collected inspection images using
   the UAV with optimized flight mission are evaluated. The results show
   that this method leads to time-efficient, accurate, and high-quality
   inspection data collection for building surface.},

Title = {BIM-based indoor mobile robot initialization for construction automation
   using object detection},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {146},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been increasing interest in robotic solutions
   to revolutionize the conventional construction industry. Despite various
   advances in developing mobile robotic solutions for construction
   automation. One key bottleneck towards a fully automated robotic
   solution in construction is the initialization of the mobile robot.
   Currently, most of the commercialized mobile construction robots are
   manually initialized before autonomous navigation can be performed at
   the construction sites for automated tasks. Even if the robot is
   initialized, the location information can be lost while navigating and
   re-initialization is required to resume the navigation. Any wrong
   initialization can cause failure in robot pose tracking and thus prevent
   the robot from performing the planned tasks. However, in indoor
   construction sites, GPS is not accessible, and indoor infrastructures,
   such as beacon devices are not available for robot initialization. In
   addition, construction environments are dynamic with significant change
   in scenes and structures for different construction blocks and floors,
   making pre-scanning of the environments and map matching difficult and
   time-consuming. An infrastructure-free and environment-independent robot
   initialization method is therefore required. In this paper, we propose
   an integrated Building Information Model (BIM)-based indoor robot
   initialization system using an object detector to automatically
   initialize the mobile robot when it is deployed at an unknown location.
   Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection technique is
   used to detect and locate the visual features, which are widely
   distributed building components at construction sites. A feature
   matching algorithm is developed to correlate the acquired online
   information of detected features with geometric and semantic information
   retrieved from BIM. The robot location in the BIM coordinate frame is
   then estimated based on the feature association. Moreover, the proposed
   system aggregates the BIM information and the sensory information to
   supervise the online robot decision making, making the entire system
   fully automatic. The proposed system is validated through experiments in
   various environments including a university building and ongoing
   construction sites.},

Title = {Automated detailing of exterior walls using NADIA:
   Natural-language-based architectural detailing through interaction with
   AI},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Learning building information modeling (BIM) systems has always been a
   challenge for BIM adoption. Although groundbreaking performances of
   large language models (LLMs) have inspired many researchers to consider
   an LLM as a potential BIM control method using natural language, a
   specific method of utilizing LLMs for automated BIM model detailing has
   not yet been proposed. This paper proposes an LLM-BIM chaining framework
   to enable architectural design detailing using natural language, instead
   of using menu -based user interfaces, named ``Natural -language -based
   Architectural Detailing through Interaction with AI (NADIA){''}. The
   NADIA framework is based on three main approaches: 1) separating the
   specification of the wall layers from the creation of the wall layers;
   2) appropriate instruction prompting to guide the LLM to minimize
   irrational responses and produce engineering rational details; and 3)
   LLM-BIM chaining to seamlessly link a BIM authoring tool and an LLM. The
   effectiveness of NADIA was validated based on two main aspects: its
   accuracy in generating details that adhere to specified design
   requirements from users-as a design assistant-and its compliance with
   general engineering requirements-as a design consultant. The validation
   was achieved through tasks that involved generating 240 and 1,920
   exterior wall details, respectively. NADIA achieved an average accuracy
   of 83.33\% in generating logically coherent details in line with the
   required design conditions. For thermal performance requirements, it
   demonstrated a mean accuracy of 98.54\% in complying with the American
   Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air -Conditioning Engineers
   (ASHRAE) 20.1-2019 standard. Despite being in its early stages, NADIA's
   potential for developing and refining architectural details through
   natural language -based interactions between architects and machines is
   promising.},

Journal = {ANNALS OF GIS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {99-109},
Abstract = {Integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Geographic
   Information System (GIS) can benefit both the Architecture, Engineering
   and Construction/Facility Management (AEC/FM) domain, and the geospatial
   industry. For GIS, BIM is a promising source of three-dimensional (3D)
   building information that can be used in the study of smart city, green
   building, big data, etc. The underlying data transformation from
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to shapefile enables GIS to use the
   rich building information. However, this transformation is difficult due
   to the different modelling methods used by IFC and shapefile. IFC
   generally represents 3D objects using boundary representation (Brep),
   swept solid, constructive solid geometry (CSG), clipping and mapped
   representation, while shapefile only uses Brep. In addition, the use of
   different coordinate systems also contributes to the geometry
   transformation issue. Among all the solid modelling methods used by IFC,
   Brep and swept solid are the most often used two methods. Compared with
   Brep, the transformation of swept solid is more challenging as each type
   of profile for swept solid defined in IFC has to be properly interpreted
   and converted. This paper develops algorithms to interpret the commonly
   used profiles of swept solid for the transformation of IFC into
   shapefile. A bridge model is used to validate the proposed method, and a
   Web GIS-based bridge management system is developed to demonstrate a
   possible usage of the transformed shapefile model.},

Title = {Enhancing energy performance assessment and labeling in buildings: A
   review of BIM-based approaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {103},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Buildings are central to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions. However, energy labeling programs, intended to encourage
   sustainable practices, often encounter challenges such as data
   inaccuracies, manual processes, and discrepancies between estimated and
   actual energy consumption. This study examines how Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) can contribute to improving the accuracy, reliability,
   and efficiency of energy labeling, addressing existing gaps in current
   practices. Through a systematic literature review, the research compiles
   insights from recent studies that demonstrate BIM's potential to
   centralize and automate building data, reduce errors in energy
   assessments, and facilitate integration with Building Energy Modeling
   (BEM) tools for more consistent simulations. The findings indicate that
   BIM-based methods, including model generation techniques,
   multi-objective optimization, and digital twin applications, help
   mitigate the performance gap by enabling data updates, improving
   interoperability, and offering better occupant behavior modeling.
   Nevertheless, several challenges remain, such as ensuring data quality,
   enhancing open data standards, and refining tools to accommodate
   evolving energy systems. A key novelty of this review lies in
   synthesizing a broad range of BIM-driven approaches into a cohesive
   perspective on how energy labeling can be modernized and enriched. By
   proposing future research paths that further integrate these BIM-based
   solutions, this study underscores BIM's capacity to streamline labeling
   processes through advanced analytics and automation, ultimately
   supporting more informed retrofits, regulatory compliance, and
   sustainable design strategies. In summary, the review suggests that BIM
   can enhance current labeling methodologies and contribute to broader
   sustainability goals in the built environment.},

Title = {Data Transfer Reliability from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)-A Comparative Case Study of an Industrial
   Warehouse},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The automation of environmental assessment processes aimed at reducing
   the ecological footprint of industrial facilities, buildings, and
   infrastructure is one of the main challenges currently faced by the
   construction sector. In this context, Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) is a comprehensive methodology that enables the creation of
   digital models, facilitating the analysis of environmental performance
   throughout the life cycle of built assets. In addition to the
   capabilities offered by BIM, specialized tools for environmental impact
   analysis implement the standardized life cycle assessment (LCA)
   methodology. However, one of the current limitations is the integration
   of BIM models and LCA tools. Few software solutions enable automated
   data transfer, complicating the environmental assessment process. The
   objective of this study is to evaluate the reliability of data transfer
   from BIM models to LCA tools, using an industrial warehouse as a case
   study. The research compares two LCA tools: Athena Impact Estimator,
   specialized in the construction sector, and SimaPro, a professional tool
   with advanced capabilities. This study is structured in two phases: (i)
   the development of a BIM model in Revit, including the definition of
   structural and functional components and the export of data to LCA
   tools, and (ii) the execution of the life cycle assessment in compliance
   with ISO 14040 and EN 15804 standards. The results show methodological
   and interoperability differences between the two tools, highlighting
   their strengths and limitations in terms of the precision of the
   results, resource consumption, training and expertise requirements,
   scope of environmental impact calculations, and adaptability to the
   construction sector in the integration of an LCA with a BIM model.},

   international standard approach integrating key decision variables to
   support scientific computations and decision-making for whole-life-cycle
   net-zero-carbon buildings. Building information modelling (BIM) is an
   open international standard representing building information. Digital
   Twin (DT) can capture and monitor real-time building conditions to
   facilitate building operation. Integrating information acquired by DT
   with BIM has considerable potential to enable an open international
   standard based computational representation of key decision variables
   throughout the whole-building life cycle process. This paper aims to
   develop a novel conceptual framework that integrates BIM and DT to
   support net-zero-carbon buildings. The framework is developed using an
   open international standard approach and the ontology-based
   representation method, to define key decision variables using entities,
   properties, and relationships, and integrates captured data via DT. The
   research makes significant contributions to enable net-zero-carbon
   buildings and paves the way for future research on an automated system
   to support decision-making for the whole-life-cycle net-zero-carbon
   buildings.},

Title = {Towards BIM-Based Sustainable Structural Design Optimization: A
   Systematic Review and Industry Perspective},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Structural design optimization (SDO) plays a pivotal role in enhancing
   various aspects of construction projects, including design quality, cost
   efficiency, safety, and structural reliability. Recent endeavors in
   academia and industry have sought to harness the potential of building
   information modeling (BIM) and optimization algorithms to optimize SDO
   and improve design outcomes. This review paper aims to synthesize these
   efforts, shedding light on how SDO contributes to project coordination.
   Furthermore, the integration of sustainability considerations and the
   application of innovative technologies and optimization algorithms in
   SDO necessitate more interactive early stage collaboration among project
   stakeholders. This study offers a comprehensive exploration of
   contemporary research in integrated SDO employing BIM and optimization
   algorithms. It commences with an exploratory investigation, employing
   both qualitative and quantitative analysis techniques following the
   PRISMA systematic review methodology. Subsequently, an open-ended
   opinion survey was conducted among construction industry professionals
   in Europe. This survey yields valuable insights into the coordination
   challenges and potential solutions arising from technological shifts and
   interoperability concerns associated with the widespread implementation
   of SDO. These preliminary steps of systematic review and industry survey
   furnish a robust foundation of knowledge, enabling the proposal of an
   intelligent framework for automating early stage sustainable structural
   design optimization (ESSDO) within the construction sector. The ESSDO
   framework addresses the challenges of fragmented collaboration between
   architects and structural engineers. This proposed framework seamlessly
   integrates with the BIM platform, i.e., Autodesk Revit for architects.
   It extracts crucial architectural data and transfers it to the
   structural design and analysis platform, i.e., Autodesk Robot Structural
   Analysis (RSA), for structural engineers via the visual programming tool
   Dynamo. Once the optimization occurs, optimal outcomes are visualized
   within BIM environments. This visualization elevates interactive
   collaborations between architects and engineers, facilitating automation
   throughout the workflow and smoother information exchange.},

Abstract = {In response to the increasing complexity encountered in postearthquake
   recovery within the construction sector, there is a pressing need for
   more accurate and efficient methods. Leveraging emerging technologies to
   automate processes is a feasible approach to tackle these challenges
   effectively. This study focuses on integrating building information
   modeling (BIM), deep learning (DL), and web map services (WMS) to
   accelerate and improve the recovery planning for earthquake-damaged
   buildings. This integrated approach not only supports sustainable
   construction goals but also has the potential to reduce planning time by
   10\%-15\%, depending on project situations, while decreasing the
   resources required. The research used a BIM-based platform, applying a
   vision transformer for image classification and Detectron2 for instance
   segmentation, to accurately identify damage in structural elements and
   streamline damage evaluation process through automation. Implementing a
   BIM- and WMS-based plugin further enhances this process, enabling
   automated and data-driven recovery planning incorporating sustainability
   considerations. A case study demonstrated this integrated BIM-DL-WMS
   approach on an actual recovery project. The result underlines the
   potential of these technologies to revolutionize postearthquake recovery
   efforts in the construction industry. They make the recovery process
   more efficient, accurate, and sustainable.},

Title = {Automatic generation of building information models from digitized plans},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {113},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach to creating Building Information
   (BIM) models of existing buildings from digitized images. This automatic
   approach is based on three main steps. The first involves extracting the
   useful information automatically from rasterized plans by using image
   processing techniques that include segmentation, filtering, dilation,
   erosion, and contour detection. This information feeds the knowledge
   base of an expert system for BIM model generation. In the second step,
   using the knowledge base of the expert system, the information required
   to inform the BIM model can be deduced. The range of information thus
   obtainable can be extended beyond the examples given. The paper
   concludes with a discussion of the final stage: the automatic generation
   of an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) information model with all the
   desired geometric, physical and technical information. This can be
   accomplished by using one of the available open-source application
   program interfaces (APIs). This stage is currently work-in-progress and
   will be the subject of a future publication.},

Abstract = {3D concrete printing (3DCP) has attracted significant attention due to
   the benefits of enhanced productivity and sustainability. However,
   existing 3DCP techniques face challenges of automation and practicality
   in integrating conventional rebar reinforcement with printed concrete
   structures. This study presents an automated robot system coupled with
   Building Information Modeling (BIM) to address the challenge. Dynamo
   scripts in BIM were used to generate printing paths, further optimised
   by a proposed algorithm for incorporating rebar reinforcement. A deep
   learning model was adopted to identify rebars with large aspect ratios.
   The average accuracy of rebar recognition is 92.5\%, with a position
   error within 2 mm. A centralised control system was developed for
   multiple-device communication, including a camera, a robot arm, and a
   gripper. Finally, a real-time demonstration was conducted, representing
   the first practical demonstration of an automated robotic system to
   integrate rebar reinforcement with printed structures using
   BIM-generated data in the physical world.},

Title = {Innovative Point Cloud Segmentation of 3D Light Steel Framing System
   through Synthetic BIM and Mixed Reality Data: Advancing Construction
   Monitoring},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In recent years, mixed reality (MR) technology has gained popularity in
   construction management due to its real-time visualisation capability to
   facilitate on-site decision-making tasks. The semantic segmentation of
   building components provides an attractive solution towards digital
   construction monitoring, reducing workloads through automation
   techniques. Nevertheless, data shortages remain an issue in maximizing
   the performance potential of deep learning segmentation methods. The
   primary aim of this study is to address this issue through synthetic
   data generation using Building Information Modelling (BIM) models. This
   study presents a point-cloud-based deep learning segmentation approach
   to a 3D light steel framing (LSF) system through synthetic BIM models
   and as-built data captured using MR headsets. A standardisation workflow
   between BIM and MR models was introduced to enable seamless data
   exchange across both domains. A total of five different experiments were
   set up to identify the benefits of synthetic BIM data in supplementing
   actual as-built data for model training. The results showed that the
   average testing accuracy using solely as-built data stood at 82.88\%.
   Meanwhile, the introduction of synthetic BIM data into the training
   dataset led to an improved testing accuracy of 86.15\%. A hybrid dataset
   also enabled the model to segment both the BIM and as-built data
   captured using an MR headset at an average accuracy of 79.55\%. These
   findings indicate that synthetic BIM data have the potential to
   supplement actual data, reducing the costs associated with data
   acquisition. In addition, this study demonstrates that deep learning has
   the potential to automate construction monitoring tasks, aiding in the
   digitization of the construction industry.},

Title = {Automatic geo-referencing of BIM in GIS environments using building
   footprints},
Journal = {COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {80},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The integration of Building Information Models (BIM) in environments
   such as Geographic Information System (GIS) is currently one of the main
   investigated research problem in the urban spatial information
   community. Among the several issues that are involved in the adequate
   realisation of such type of integration, one particularly relevant to
   the GIS world is the geo-referencing of data coming from the BIM domain.
   The latter, which is inherited from the Computer Aided Design (CAD)
   world, often relies on local coordinate systems and thereby provides
   models with no or wrong information with respect to their actual
   geographic position. Based on well-known processes in the field of
   computer vision, this paper proposes an automatic framework that allows
   to transform the local coordinates of a BIM model into its real world
   geographic coordinates. Starting from a geo-referenced 2D polygon of the
   building (footprint or vertical projection), our method directly applies
   a rigid motion transformation to a corresponding 2D projection generated
   from the BIM model in order to obtain the transformation matrix that
   will align the geometry of the BIM to the map's one. In comparison with
   the most common approaches of shape alignment and rigid body
   transformation, our approach requires neither the input polygons to have
   the same number of points nor their sequence of points to be
   corresponding, allowing thereby to maximize the automation of the
   process while still providing accurate results. Several cases of BIM
   geo-referencing are presented and discussed. Furthermore, our
   experiments show that centimetre accurary can be reached in the
   alignment process.},

Title = {An innovative approach to automate BIM data retrieval and processing for
   building acoustic comfort calculations based on the IFC standard},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {266},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Nowadays, there is a growing demand for deep renovation projects aimed
   at improving the energy efficiency of buildings while enhancing indoor
   comfort conditions for the inhabitants, both thermal and acoustic. To
   design effective renovation strategies, technicians need to know the
   current state of the building to propose acoustic or only thermal
   improvements. However, evaluating indoor acoustic comfort requires
   time-consuming and tedious calculations, which can be prone to errors
   when handled manually. While Building Information Modelling (BIM) can
   facilitate this process by leveraging the extensive contained data and
   offering the potential to automate these processes, such automation is
   not yet widespread. Typically, only geometric data is retrieved
   automatically from BIM models in acoustic software, while acoustic
   parameters must be provided manually. This paper addresses these
   challenges by introducing a novel approach that integrates automated
   data extraction from BIM with acoustic simulation tools. Specifically,
   an Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) solution was designed to
   automatically retrieve both geometric and acoustic data for an Acoustic
   Comfort tool, which calculates an estimation of indoor acoustic comfort,
   from an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). This approach was tested in a
   demonstration case located in Spain, showing a significant reduction in
   processing time and increased accuracy compared to traditional methods
   of manually extracting data from BIM for acoustic assessment. This
   research represents a significant advance in acoustic simulations by
   integrating IFC data with automated processing, improving accuracy and
   offering practical advantages for developing more efficient and reliable
   BIM-based applications, thus supporting the design of deep renovation
   projects.},

Journal = {INFRASTRUCTURES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {In recent decades, the condition of many bridge structures has
   deteriorated and the need for maintenance measures has increased. Until
   now, these maintenance measures have mainly been carried out manually
   and reactively. The use of digital 3D models based on Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) can remedy this situation and create the
   basis for predictive maintenance management. While the generation of 3D
   models of new bridge structures is simple, the digitization of existing
   structures can be a complex process. This article provides an overview
   of the state of the scientific practice with regard to the procedures,
   technologies and data used to generate 3D models of existing bridge
   structures using the BIM method. Using a systematic literature analysis,
   scientific databases are searched for suitable literature and analysed
   with predefined filtering parameters. The results provide a uniform
   understanding of the current status quo of the digitisation of existing
   bridge structures and show existing degrees of digitisation and
   automation.},

Abstract = {ContextThe interface of Hsp70-Bim protein-protein interaction (PPI) has
   been identified as a specific target for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
   therapy and the specific inhibitors were developed to exhibit in vivo
   anti-leukemia activities. Herein, we explored the binding mechanism of a
   Hsp70-Bim inhibitor, 6-(cyclohexylthio)-3-((2-morpholinoethyl)
   amino)-1-oxo-1H-phenalene-2-carbonitrile (S1g-6), to Hsp70 at the atomic
   level by MD simulation. TYR-149, THR-222, ALA-223, and GLY-224 on Hsp70
   were identified as four key residues that contribute to Hsp70/S1g-6
   complex. Moreover, the site mutation validation demonstrated the TYR-149
   of Hsp70 is a ``hot-spot{''} in the Hsp70-Bim PPI interface. These
   results could benefit the design of further inhibitors to occupy the Bim
   binding site on the Hsp70 surface.MethodsThe binding mechanism of S1g-6
   and Hsp70 was predicted through the molecular dynamics (MD) method by
   Gromacs-2021.3. The MD simulation was performed with 100-ps NVT and
   100-ps NPT ensemble, and the force field was chosen as the Charmm36
   force field. The temperature was set as 300 K, the time step was 2 fs
   and the total MD simulation time was 500 ns.},

Abstract = {The construction industry is a major contributor to global carbon
   emissions, with embodied carbon emissions from materials significantly
   impacting sustainability. Addressing these challenges requires
   innovative digital solutions for optimizing material selection and
   resource efficiency. This study introduces a BIM-based Value Engineering
   (VE) plugin that integrates cost, energy consumption, and embodied
   carbon assessments within BIM environments. Employing a mixed-methods
   approach, including theoretical modelling and a case study, the research
   demonstrates a 10\% reduction in project costs and a 15\% decrease in
   embodied carbon emissions. The findings highlight the role of digital
   tools in enhancing sustainability by enabling data-driven
   decision-making and lifecycle optimization. This study advances
   sustainable construction practices by presenting a structured
   methodology for integrating BIM and VE, offering a scalable framework
   that minimizes carbon footprints while enhancing both economic and
   environmental performance. These insights provide a foundation for
   further research and practical applications in low-carbon construction.},

   PERSPECTIVE},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {The management of building commissioning requires specialists from
   different organizations and with different skills. Collaboration
   processes involves several actors and decision-making at different
   levels. As building commissioning has already been described as
   systems-of-systems (SoS), the research reported in this paper claims
   that this definition can be extended into cyber-physical
   system-of-systems (CPSoS), requiring identification and support of both
   human-machine and machine-machine interactions in a hybrid environment.
   These requirements give rise to several challenges, such as capturing
   information about the existing facility, visualizing, comparing, and
   validating the compliance of alternative commissioning projects. The
   study presented in this paper reports methodological and technological
   solutions that are built on the integration between BIM and mixed
   reality, to actualize a CPSoS paradigm and to implement human-machine
   interaction for situated cognition towards an immersive collaborative
   working environment. The results of the experimental platform have been
   showcased in a full-scale real-life demonstrator.},

Abstract = {The need to optimize investments in bridge maintenance has created a
   demand for improved bridge management systems (BMS). Outdated practices
   in bridge inspection and constant advances in information technology
   have also contributed to this demand. The use of Digital Twins (DT),
   although well established in other industries, is still incipient for
   asset management and structural analysis of bridges. There is a great
   deal of research on Building Information Modelling (BIM) for bridge
   inspection, but its post-construction potential is still under-explored.
   This study presents a state-of-the-art review of the literature on asset
   management for bridges using digital models such as BIM and digital
   twins. The review was conducting using a systematic approach. Despite
   the rapid increase in research on DT and the amount of existing research
   on BIM, several gaps remain to be addressed, such as the lack of
   consensus about the definition of digital twins, which has led to
   wrongful categorisation of digital models as DT. The complex data flow
   and software compatibility required to develop a functional DT have
   hindered the exploitation of their full potential so far. The
   integration of BIM post-construction to BMS and existing automation
   technologies can also significantly improve current practices of bridge
   management.},

Title = {Optimising energy performance of an Eco-Home using Building Information
   Modelling (BIM)},
Journal = {INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {In a world where sustainability constantly manifests itself as the
   contemporaneous zeitgeist in practically every facade of our lives, it
   is imperative to understand the energy performances (EP) of buildings,
   both old and new, and explore innovative ways to optimise this cardinal
   aspect of building operation. In this light, we investigate the
   potential benefits of integrating Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   into EP analysis of built infrastructures. This research, in the form of
   a case study, has been designed to uncover equipments of high energy
   consumption in an Eco-Home, and subsequently to compare BIM-based
   simulations with the actual data measured on energy consumption. From
   the analysis, this study also proposes several recommendations on energy
   optimisation. For the purpose of EP analysis and simulation runs,
   Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS) has been deployed, while 3D BIM
   Model of the Eco-Home was generated using Autodesk Revit. In situ energy
   audit revealed that the air-conditioner was the most energy-intensive
   equipment in the Eco-Home. Only a small variation of energy consumption
   was observed in actual and simulated data. Further analysis on design
   alternatives illustrated that the EP of the Eco-Home can be vastly
   improved by adopting a few measures, such as the installation of
   occupancy sensors to automate lighting, the integration of greywater
   reclamation system to reduce water consumption, and the addition of
   photovoltaic panels to increase renewable energy generation. However,
   from the same analysis, wind energy was found to be inviable due to its
   low level of energy potential. This paper concludes that integrating BIM
   and GBS into EP analysis not only improves the overall EP measurements,
   but also acts as an enabler for designers and building owners to compare
   design alternatives effectively. The advancement of BIM integration in
   this study offers an interesting proposition for the architectural,
   engineering, and construction industry especially when it comes to the
   enhancement of sustainability of a building.},

Title = {Path Planning for Construction Robot Based on the Improved A{*}
   Algorithm and Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Path planning is a key technology in the automation of construction
   robots, and its implementation mainly relies on navigation algorithms
   and the generation of environment maps. However, the original A{*}
   algorithm has issues such as not considering dimensional constraints, a
   high number of turning nodes, and unsmooth paths. Moreover, traditional
   environment map generation is time-consuming and energy-consuming.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a path-planning method for construction
   robots based on an improved A{*} algorithm and BIM. First, the A{*}
   algorithm is improved by incorporating dimensional constraints for both
   the building and the robot and by reasonably setting virtual obstacles
   to enhance the feasibility of robot movement. Additionally, B-spline
   curves are used to optimize the path, reduce turning points, and achieve
   a smoother trajectory. Second, Dynamo visual programming is used to
   process the building's BIM model, enabling efficient generation of the
   environment map while preserving the rich semantic and geometric
   information of the building. Finally, the improved A{*} algorithm is
   employed to perform path planning within the environment map generated
   from the BIM model, resulting in the generation of the optimal path.
   Through experimental verification on the civil engineering building of a
   university, the results show that the improved A{*} algorithm can
   successfully navigate within the BIM-generated map. It not only ensures
   the safety and smoothness of path planning but also enables the fast and
   efficient generation of environment maps. This effectively advances the
   research and application of BIM technology in the field of robot
   navigation.},

Title = {An ontology-based methodology to establish city information model of
   digital twin city by merging BIM, GIS and IoT},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {57},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {With the development of digital city and smart city construction, the
   City Information Model (CIM) has played a critical role as a container
   of spatial-temporal data to establish the Digital Twin City. For a
   digital twin city, a virtual high-fidelity CIM model that corresponds
   closely to the real physical world is the premise and cornerstone of its
   construction. Therefore, the integration of BIM, GIS and IoT has become
   the preferred topic for researchers and has received much more attention
   from a wide academic circle. However, traditional integration mainly
   focuses on the conversion of both IFC and CityGML, and IoT data are also
   often used as visualizations. More importantly, the underlying data
   formats of GIS, BIM and IoT are still independent of each other without
   a unified data structure expression, so real data-driven analysis and
   decision-making cannot be implemented. This study aims to establish a
   general CIM ontology to integrate heterogeneous BIM, GIS and IoT data.
   First, the related work of BIM, GIS and IoT integration is studied and
   analyzed. A comparison of three mainstream approaches, data conversion,
   standard extension and data linking, is conducted, and it illustrates
   the advantages of ontology techniques in solving data interoperability
   problems. Second, a technical framework of BIM, GIS and IoT data
   integration based on ontology technology is proposed. The approach is
   mainly divided into five steps: geometry processing, data instantiation,
   ontology construction, ontology mapping and querying application. On the
   basis of the CIM ontology, an application ontology is built for a
   specific application domain to illustrate rulebased mapping, querying
   and inferring. Finally, the case study shows that the Ontology-based
   methodology in this paper has contributed to establish a general pattern
   for CIM data integration by mapping and linking concepts from the
   semantic level. It avoids changes in the original data sources and the
   missing data problem.},

Title = {Holistic Construction Automation With Modular Robots: From High-Level
   Task Specification to Execution},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {16716-16727},
Abstract = {In situ robotic automation in construction is challenging due to
   constantly changing environments, a shortage of robotic experts, and a
   lack of standardized frameworks bridging robotics and construction
   practices. This work proposes a holistic framework for construction task
   specification, optimization of robot morphology, and mission execution
   using a mobile modular reconfigurable robot. Users can specify and
   monitor the desired robot behavior through a graphical interface. In
   contrast to existing, monolithic solutions, we automatically identify a
   new task-tailored robot for every task by integrating Building
   Information Modeling (BIM). Our framework leverages modular robot
   components that enable the fast adaption of robot hardware to the
   specific demands of the construction task. Other than previous works on
   modular robot optimization, we consider multiple competing objectives,
   which allow us to explicitly model the challenges of real-world
   transfer, such as calibration errors. We demonstrate our framework in
   simulation by optimizing robots for drilling and spray painting.
   Finally, experimental validation demonstrates that our approach robustly
   enables the autonomous execution of robotic drilling. Note to
   Practitioners-Construction sites are unpredictable and constantly
   changing, making automation difficult. To tackle this, we propose a
   modular robotic system that can adapt to specific tasks. In this work,
   we address the challenge of automating robotic drilling and introduce a
   general framework that also supports other construction tasks. We use
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) data to automatically determine the
   best robot configuration by optimizing factors such as setup time and
   robustness to positioning errors. Through an intuitive interface,
   workers can specify tasks, after which they assemble the robot following
   the provided instructions. The result of this work is a robotic system
   that can be deployed on diverse construction sites while requiring only
   readily available BIM data and minimal user inputs. Our approach enables
   the same hardware to be deployed across various scenarios while
   accounting for site-specific challenges. A core innovation lies in
   combining modular robotics with automated optimization, task planning,
   and motion planning to minimize the need for user intervention while
   delivering robots specifically tailored to each task. To achieve this,
   we extend methods for modular robot design to account for multiple
   conflicting objectives in the optimization process. Experimental results
   demonstrate the ability of the system to perform autonomous drilling
   with high precision. Beyond drilling, this framework has the potential
   to support a wide range of applications, and we show its applicability
   to spray painting in simulation. Overall, it offers a practical and
   adaptable solution for diverse construction tasks and sites.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modeling is an essential element for the
   digitization of the construction industry and forms the basis for the
   exchange of model-based data. In order to exploit the full potential of
   digitization, it is necessary for all stakeholders to operate digitally
   and avoid media discontinuities and format changes. A particular part in
   this process is given to the building authority, which has to examine
   and approve every application for a building permit. Our long-term goal
   is to automate the approval process in Austria; to reach this goal, we
   investigate which tasks have the highest potential for automation. We
   address this research question by interviewing the main stakeholders, by
   evaluating the tasks for the ability to automate them, and by clustering
   them in order to identify common subroutines and algorithms. As a
   result, we identify eight algorithmic tasks that can be automated and
   that are a part of every approval process, and we implemented these
   algorithms to prove the automation concept. This proof of concept is the
   basis for future automation steps in the processes of building
   authorities, whose implementation requires not only changes in the
   technical but also in the social, societal and political environments.},

Abstract = {To bridge the gap in as-built Building Information Model (BIM) creation
   between the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) community
   and the computer vision community, this paper presents an automated
   Scan-to-BIM framework for modeling both structural and nonstructural
   building components using a low-cost scanning data. The state-of-the-art
   instance-level semantic segmentation algorithm, SoftGroup, is adopted to
   classify individual building components. Detected wall segments are
   projected onto a two-dimensional (2D) XY grid, and an interest point
   detection algorithm, SuperPoint, is used to extract wall corner points.
   Subsequently, a series of refinement steps is proposed to generate the
   wall boundary. With optimized parameters, an intersection-over-union of
   82.56\% was achieved when tested on the benchmark Stanford
   Three-Dimensional (3D) Indoor Scene Data Set. Our results demonstrated
   the usability of the proposed wall boundary extraction to the incomplete
   and complex indoor scan data compared to an existing as-built modeling
   method. Instance-level segments and the refined wall boundary were
   combined to generate as-built BIM via parametric modeling.},

   documentation that takes time to prepare, review, and approve. As such,
   there is a need for a reliable payment automation system that guarantees
   timely execution of payments upon the detection of completed works.
   Therefore, this study used a cutting-edge approach to automate
   construction payments by integrating blockchain-enabled smart contracts
   and scan-to-Building Information Modeling (BIM). In this approach,
   scan-to-BIM provides accurate, real-time building progress data, which
   serve as the source of verifiable off-chain data. A chain-link is then
   used to securely relay these data to the blockchain system.
   Blockchain-enabled smart contracts automate the execution of payments
   upon meeting contract conditions. The proposed approach was implemented
   on a real case study project. The actual site scan was captured using a
   photogrammetry 360 degrees camera, which uses a combination of
   structured light and infrared depth sensing technology to capture 3D
   data and create detailed 3D models of spaces. This study leveraged
   accurate, real-time building progress data to automate payments using
   blockchain-enabled smart contracts upon work completion, thus reducing
   payment disputes by tying payments to verifiable construction progress,
   leading to faster release of payments. The findings show that this
   approach provides a transparent basis for payment, enhancing trust and
   allowing precise project progress tracking.},

Abstract = {Application of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in architecture,
   engineering, and construction industry is known for its productivity and
   efficiency. Green BIM is one of the recent applications that aids users
   in achieving sustainability and/or improved building performance
   objectives through design and analysis of digital semantic models. The
   focus is on the application of green BIM for water efficiency (WE)
   analysis in accordance with the Malaysian Green Building Index (GBI) as
   a sustainability assessment tool. Revit Green Project Template (RGPT)
   and Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS) as two available BIM tools were
   selected to evaluate and compare the applicability of each method for
   GBI WE assessment. To resolve the limitations identified from each
   evaluated method, automated GBI assessment tool (AGBIA) was developed as
   an alternative. The AGBIA as a supporting tool was established with the
   use of Dynamo, a visual programming tool to compensate for the
   limitations faced in the investigated methods. The practicality of each
   method was explored using a hypothetical model in Revit to automate
   information correspondent to 10 water efficiency assessment points and
   generate reports and documents necessary for the GBI design stage
   certification. The final phase involves verification of results obtained
   from each method using the conventional GBI WE calculator. AGBIA is
   suitable for the green BIM users in Malaysia based on the flexibility
   and automation over defining and assigning green parameters that are in
   line with the local context, the direct link of green information to the
   model, as well as the detail of presented data.},

Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodology is becoming widespread
   with many potential uses, such as facility and asset management for new
   buildings. Recently, it has also been applied for the maintenance of
   built heritage, within the so-called Historical BIM (HBIM) field. A BIM
   model, empowered by detailed embedded information, is an excellent tool
   to monitor and infer on the behaviour, performance and deterioration of
   heritage buildings, collecting and classifying diverse data that can
   co-exist in an asset model. However, three main issues must be tackled:
   lack of standardization, insufficient interoperability and inherent
   complexity of the information. It is essential to balance model's
   geometrical and non-geometrical features, such as the level of detail
   accuracy and the quantity of linked information, to make the methodology
   cost-effective and hence more attractive for end-users. The present work
   focuses on the development of easy-to-implement strategy to report and
   monitor damage evolution over time. Standardization and simplification
   of the procedures are pursued by using Product Data Templates (PDTs) and
   focusing on interoperability of information through specific provisions
   of export/import definitions for Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The
   developed methodology is tested on the Ducal Palace in Guimaraes,
   Portugal, one of the most prominent monuments of the country.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The provision of data with information management are a significant
   challenge for the digital developing construction industry. The
   utilisation of data from a built asset's planning, design, and
   construction phases to the operations phase core and to the facility
   management function of building and integration in supporting core
   business and support services is frequently limited due to technical
   obstacles in information management. The paper presents the second of
   three stages of design science research to propose a conceptual approach
   for the implementation of the ``as-a-service{''} method for the
   construction industry, namely ``Building-as-a-Service{''} (BaaS). BaaS
   involves a shift in the concept of services: users become recipients of
   services generated by the building, not only services provided in the
   building. The paper shows the interdependencies between these various
   concepts and suggests a possible framework for the inclusion of these
   ``as-a-Service{''} approaches for enabling a Digital Twin based on
   Building Information Modelling, which is becoming mandatory in several
   European states. The study gathered the foundational theoretical
   constructs through a literature review and elucidated them to make the
   proposed framework feasible. The theoretical foundations comprise
   Building Information Modelling (BIM), the Digital Twin (DT), the
   interconnecting technology of smart applications and the practical
   application in projects. The approach of ``Building-as-a-Service{''} in
   combination with smart applications can be an approach to making the use
   of buildings available in a resource-saving way to clients, building
   owners and users.},

Abstract = {The development of building information modelling has facilitated the
   improvement of cost and time management in panelized construction. This
   research proposes an automated method to design and draft drainage
   systems in the BIM environment. The proposed method can improve design
   efficiency, eliminate design errors, and reduce material waste. In order
   to improve production efficiency at the panelized construction plant,
   the drainage pipe network is separated into smaller components at the
   geometric boundaries of the plumbing panel which is a floor or wall
   panel through which pipes pass. Meanwhile, a bill of materials for each
   plumbing panel is generated for the purpose of further cutting
   optimization. A prototyped BIM extension application, an add-on to
   Autodesk Revit, is developed as a proof of concept. A case study of
   residential drainage system design and optimization is presented to
   illustrate the feasibility of the proposed framework. As the key
   contribution of this research, the integration of the BIM model with the
   automated design system, rule-based pipe route planning approach, and
   optimal cutting stock algorithm achieves the automation in drainage
   system design in the context of panelized construction to improve design
   and production efficiency.},

   Industry Practice and Needs},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The climate debate necessitates reducing greenhouse gas emissions from
   buildings. A common and standardized method of assessing this is life
   cycles assessment (LCA); however, time and costs are a barrier. Large
   efficiency potentials are associated with using data from building
   information models (BIM) for the LCA, but development is still at an
   early stage. This study investigates the industry practice and needs for
   BIM-LCA, and if these are met through a prototype for the Danish
   context, using IFC and a 3D view. Eight qualitative in-depth interviews
   were conducted with medium and large architect, engineering, and
   contractor companies, covering a large part of the Danish AEC industry.
   The companies used a quantity take-off approach, and a few were
   developing plug-in approaches. Challenges included the lack of quality
   in the models, thus most companies supplemented model data with other
   data sources. Features they found valuable for BIM-LCA included visual
   interface, transparency of data, automation, design evaluation, and
   flexibility. The 3D view of the prototype met some of the needs,
   however, there were mixed responses on the use of IFC, due to different
   workflow needs in the companies. Future BIM-LCA development should
   include considerations on the lack of quality in models and should
   support different workflows.},

Title = {Photogrammetry and deep learning for energy production prediction and
   building-integrated photovoltaics decarbonization},
Journal = {BUILDING SIMULATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Building-Integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) have emerged as a promising
   sustainable energy solution, relying on accurate energy production
   predictions and effective decarbonization strategies for efficient
   deployment. This paper presents a novel approach that combines
   photogrammetry and deep learning techniques to address the problem of
   BIPV decarbonization. The method is called BIM-AITIZATION referring to
   the integration of BIM data, AI techniques, and automation principles.
   It integrates photogrammetric data into practical BIM parameters. In
   addition, it enhances the precision and reliability of PV energy
   prediction by using artificial intelligence strategies. The primary aim
   of this approach is to offer advanced, data-driven energy forecasts and
   BIPV decarbonization while fully automating the underlying process. To
   achieve this, the first step is to capture point cloud data of the
   building through photogrammetric acquisition. This data undergoes
   preprocessing to identify and remove unwanted points, followed by plan
   segmentation to extract the plan facade. After that, a meteorological
   dataset is assembled, incorporating various attributes that influence
   energy production, including solar irradiance parameters as well as BIM
   parameters. Finally, machine and deep learning techniques are used for
   accurate photovoltaic energy predictions and the automation of the
   entire process. Extensive experiments are conducted, including multiple
   tests aimed at assessing the performance of diverse machine learning
   models. The objective is to identify the most suitable model for our
   specific application. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is undertaken,
   comparing the performance of the proposed model against that of various
   established BIPV software tools. The outcomes reveal that the proposed
   approach surpasses existing software solutions in both accuracy and
   precision. To extend its applicability, the approach is evaluated using
   a building case study, demonstrating its ability to generalize
   effectively to new building data.},

Title = {Three Decades of Innovation: A Critical Bibliometric Analysis of BIM,

Abstract = {Over the past 15 years, Building Information Modelling (BIM), Historic
   BIM (HBIM), Digital Twins, and Internet of Things (IoT) have gained
   prominence in architecture, construction, and building technology. This
   study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 5568
   publications indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection between 1993
   and 2024, using VOSviewer and Biblioshiny. The analysis investigates
   publication trends, research hotspots, citation structures, and
   collaborative networks, revealing evolving patterns across countries,
   institutions, and disciplines. The peak year was 2023 (905 papers, 2226
   citations), with Automation in Construction, Buildings, and Journal of
   Building Engineering as the leading journals. Cheng JCP emerged as the
   most cited author (2059 citations, 56 papers), while Hong Kong
   Polytechnic University ranked highest in institutional output. China,
   the USA, and the UK were the top publishing countries. This study
   uniquely integrates BIM, HBIM, Digital Twins, and IoT as interconnected
   technological domains, analysing their convergence in shaping
   intelligent, data-driven infrastructure within the AEC sector. Unlike
   previous bibliometric reviews that treat these domains in isolation,
   this paper offers a unified framework and highlights underexplored
   research intersections-such as the integration of IoT in heritage
   documentation. The results show clear thematic clusters, a strong shift
   toward sustainability and interoperability, and gaps in geographic and
   methodological diversity. This bibliometric mapping not only synthesizes
   the state of research but also formulates future research directions and
   proposes original research questions that can guide scholars and
   practitioners alike.},

Title = {Data integration framework for multi-level information modelling and
   numerical analysis of deteriorated RC bridges},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {202},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Structural assessment of deteriorated bridges is a vital step in the
   decision-making process for asset management. This paper proposes a
   novel Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Finite Element (FE)
   integration framework to analyse and retrofit damaged Reinforced
   Concrete (RC) bridges. The drive behind the framework is to increase the
   efficiency and accuracy of structural assessment. To this end, a
   software tool called Bridge Damage Information Modeller (BriDIM) is
   developed. Two-way automated data interpretation and exchange between
   BIM and FE is created to allow for the evaluation of the residual
   structural capacity against limit states based on a comprehensive
   multi-level numerical model. BriDIM automatically feedback the FE
   analysis results into BIM environment for visualisation. The research
   findings suggest that utilising BIM as a database that includes
   structural specifications, damage information and retrofitting aspects
   brings benefits in terms of consistency, modelling and computational
   efficiency throughout the life cycle of a structure. The proposed
   framework transforms the way we approach assessments by consolidating
   all mechanical damage- related information into one 3D visualised BIM
   model. Ultimately BriDIM holds potential in facilitating the development
   of Digital Twins for existing structures. The model can be used to
   create scenarios of various damage combinations and provide a reliable
   tool to simulate the current condition of the bridge and the expected
   conditions of the bridge incase of damage propagation or change in
   environmental conditions.},

Title = {Smart contract swarm and multi-branch structure for secure and efficient
   BIM versioning in blockchain-aided common data environment},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Managing versions of data for building information modeling (BIM) data
   is critical for design collaboration, especially with multiple
   disciplines involved where each team has specific data requirements and
   design pro-cedures. However, existing version control approaches are
   still inefficient for two limitations: (1) lacking an efficient data
   structure for managing version dependencies among multi-disciplinary BIM
   models and (2) risking data manipulation due to a centralized versioning
   architecture that may lead to reworking, losing design traceability and
   raising disputes. Blockchain technology is an emerging and promising
   solution for version management as it provides a decentralized,
   immutable, and traceable database paradigm. Hence, this paper proposes a
   blockchain-aided solution for secure and efficient BIM versioning with
   three major innovations. Firstly, a two-layer container common data
   environment (TLCCDE) model integrating blockchain and Inter-planetary
   File System (IPFS) is developed to illustrate an overall logic for BIM
   versioning in a distributed environment. Secondly, a smart contract
   swarm (SCS) is developed to automate versioning actions in the TLCCDE.
   Thirdly, a novel multi-branch structure (MBS) with efficient algorithms
   is designed to simultaneously manage version change continuity, issue
   attachment, and dependency compliance. The proposed TLCCDE model is
   evaluated and validated in design scenarios based on a real-world
   project. Results show that: (1) the TLCCDE model is workable in BIM
   versioning; (2) TLCCDE computing performance metrics, including SCS
   latency and throughput, as well as MBS latency and scalability, are all
   validated to be practical; and (3) the TLCCDE out-performs existing
   versioning approaches by augmenting dependency automation and versioning
   cybersecurity.},

Title = {BIM for energy certification in AEC industry: bibliometric analysis of
   four certificate cases},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry is widely
   acknowledged for its substantial impact on energy consumption. Building
   Information Modeling (BIM), as a promising avenue to address the
   imperative of reducing energy consumption has been explored with
   sustainability frameworks but in specific areas, especially in its 6th
   dimension. Despite its potential, the literature shows that the
   connection between BIM and various environmental standards and
   certifications remains one of the least explored and utilized aspects.
   This study aims to identify commonalities in the application of BIM and
   environmental certifications, shedding light on both academic and
   practical gaps in the environmental management of buildings. To achieve
   this, a bibliometric literature review is conducted. Given the limited
   number of previous reviews, this study provides updated and original
   insights, serving as a foundational resource for future investigations
   into automated energy requirements. The research results reveal the four
   most widely adopted certifications, offering a substantial contribution
   to both the scientific community and AEC industry practitioners. The
   study provides a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the current
   state of the link between BIM and Green Building Certifications (GBCs).
   Despite the restriction on the databases selected and focusing on the
   most common certifications, this study gives insight into the use of BIM
   with a certification that can be efficient when used in conjunction with
   another to better optimize environmental impact throughout the life
   cycle. Moreover, it underscores the low rate of automation in GBCs
   credits and requirements, emphasizing the necessity to incorporate new
   technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain into the
   field.},

Abstract = {Timely assessment of the structural safety status of water diversion

   Strategies: A Systematic Literature Review Focusing on Daylight and
   Artificial Lighting Systems},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the architecture, engineering, and construction industries, the
   integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has become
   instrumental in shaping the design and commissioning of smart buildings.
   At the center of this development is the pursuit of more intelligent,
   efficient, and sustainable built environments. The emergence of smart
   buildings equipped with advanced sensor networks and automation systems
   increasingly requires the implementation of Digital Twins (DT) for the
   direct coupling of BIM methods for integral building planning,
   commissioning, and operational monitoring. While simulation tools and
   methods exist in the design phase of developing advanced controls, their
   mapping to construction or post-construction models is less well
   developed. Through systematic, keyword-based literature research on
   publisher-independent databases, this review paper gives a comprehensive
   overview of the state of the research on BIM integration of building
   control systems with a primary focus on combined controls for daylight
   and artificial lighting systems. The review, supported by a bibliometric
   literature analysis, highlights major development fields in HVAC
   controls, failure detection, and fire-detection systems, while the
   integration of daylight and artificial lighting controls in Digital
   Twins is still at an early stage of development. In addition to already
   existing reviews in the context of BIM and Digital planning methods,
   this review particularly intends to build the necessary knowledge base
   to further motivate research activities to integrate simulation-based
   control methods in the BIM planning process and to further close the gap
   between planning, implementation, and commissioning.},

Abstract = {Material quantity take-off is a necessary factor in estimating the cost
   of construction projects; accordingly, fast and precise estimations
   would better facilitate the overall construction process. In recent
   years, several Building Information Modeling (BIM) based applications
   (e.g., Autodesk Revit, Tekla Structure, Autodesk Navisworks Manage, and
   Solibri Model Checker) have emerged to facilitate performing quantity
   takeoff. Quantity take-off measurement using these applications is
   accurate when the length of elements multiplies by their precise section
   area. Still, the process encounters errors when using element volumes or
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). In this study, the authors examined
   the embedded quantity take-off feature of these applications for sample
   steel and reinforced concrete structures and provided precautions in
   employing BIM properties. Consequently, an automated approach was
   employed to facilitate an accurate quantity takeoff using an Application
   Program Interface (API) extracting information from a Navisworks model
   as well as database management systems. A case study was subsequently
   presented to demonstrate and validate the proposed methodology. (C) 2022

Title = {A Methodology for the Digitalization of the Residential Building
   Renovation Process through OpenBIM-Based Workflows},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {The European building industry is facing a strong increase in renovation
   processes, which are still non-cost-effective, involve unproperly
   coordinated stakeholders, are disturbing for the occupants, and cause
   important inefficiencies in the overall renovation process. In this
   context, digitalization and Building Information Modelling (BIM), as an
   enabler, is the key solution that may drive renovation interventions to
   ensure a more successful and leaner process, aiding the whole value
   chain of actors to achieve its full potential. This research describes
   the OpenBIM methodology applied in order to transform the implicit
   knowledge from the stakeholders involved in the building renovation
   process, not structured enough for automation, into an OpenBIM digital
   process based on the BIM standards. The outcomes of this research are
   the OpenBIM ready workflows that represent the renovation process and
   information requirements according to the involvement of different
   stakeholders rooted in the analysis of barriers, requirements, and
   needs. Those workflows are the basis for the future development of
   specific products and tools for boosting digitalization and
   interoperability in the renovation process.},

Title = {Automatic generation of pipelines from 2D CAD drawings to 3D IFC models
   using a parametric method},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},

Month = {APR 26},
Abstract = {Creating 3D models of pipelines is essential for effective digital
   building management. However, generating 3D pipeline models from 2D CAD
   drawings still heavily depends on human-computer interaction at the
   design stage. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a method
   to generate parametric 3D pipeline models from CAD drawings
   automatically. The framework includes three parts. Firstly, automatic
   layer recognition algorithms are used to extract data from CAD drawings,
   and algorithms are designed to match pipeline coordinates and diameters.
   Then, data on straight pipes is processed, including judging types of
   pipe fittings and calculating relevant parameters to realize the
   automatic generation of 3D BIM models. Finally, IFC is utilized to
   express the geometry and topology of models for BIM model generation.
   The process is implemented by writing a C++ program in Visio Studio
   2019. Experimental results on a building water supply and drainage
   system demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve
   the generation efficiency and automation level of pipeline models.},

Title = {Building on Digital Twin: Overcoming Barriers and Unlocking Success in
   the Construction Industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) link physical and virtual spaces, providing
   analytical and diagnostic value for built assets. Despite DT's potential
   benefits, its adoption in the construction industry is nascent, hindered
   by underexplored barriers and a lack of practical strategies. This study
   (1) identified barriers to DT adoption, (2) proposes strategies to spur
   DT adoption, and (3) prioritizes identified barriers and strategies and
   assesses the varying perceptions of organizations with different types
   and sectors on these factors. This study conducted a comprehensive
   literature review and content analysis, complemented by pilot
   interviews, to identify and categorize 25 barriers and 23 strategies. A
   survey questionnaire was distributed to industry professionals, and 91
   valid responses were received for analysis. The survey and postsurvey
   interviews helped prioritize these barriers and strategies and assess
   different construction organizations' perceptions of DT adoption.
   Additionally, two case studies were conducted to gain deeper insights
   into DT's real-world applications, barriers, and strategies. This study
   enriches the knowledge base by identifying and assessing the barriers
   and strategies for DT adoption and provides construction practitioners
   with actionable guidance for adopting DT.
   This study presents five key insights for implementing digital twins in
   the construction industry. First, it identified 25 barriers and 23
   strategies for DT adoption. Practitioners should pay attention to the
   top barriers, such as cost pressures, lack of models and data, and
   uncertain economic returns, while prioritizing effective strategies such
   as senior management support, clear objectives and expected outcomes
   from clients, and financial subsidies. Second, facility management (FM)
   and architect organizations face more challenges in adopting DT, so
   their needs should be prioritized when applying strategies. Third, the
   private sector, particularly small and medium enterprises, encounters
   greater challenges in DT adoption than the public sector due to limited
   IT infrastructure. Collaboration between the public and private sectors
   is recommended to overcome this challenge. Fourth, senior management
   plays a crucial role in creating a DT-friendly environment by training
   DT-competent employees and shifting conservative organizational
   cultures. The study presents two real-life examples of successful DT
   adoption in construction, providing valuable insights for practitioners.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces an autonomous payment administration solution,
   integrating blockchain-enabled smart contracts and robotic reality
   capture technologies. The construction progress is captured, analyzed,
   and documented respectively using sensing, machine intelligence, and
   as-built building information models (BIM). The progress data is stored
   in a distributed manner using content addressable file sharing; it is
   then broadcasted to a smart contract which administers payments and
   transfers lien rights respectively using crypto currencies/tokens and
   non-fungible tokens (NFT). The method was successfully implemented for
   payments to 7 subcontractors in two real-world commercial construction
   projects in Canada and United States where progress was captured using a
   camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground
   vehicle (UGV) equipped with a laser scanner. The method eliminates
   reliance on today's heavily intermediated payment applications and
   showed promise for achieving accurate, efficient, and timely payment
   administration. Future work should further explore the connections
   between off- and on-chain realities.},

Abstract = {Building construction has developed from the use of primitive tools to
   that of machinery, with a tendency toward automation. Automation of
   processes and robotics can improve efficiency, accuracy and safety in
   construction. On the other hand, structural prefabrication for
   construction is increasingly being adopted worldwide to enhance
   productivity and to alleviate the environmental impact of conventional
   construction processes. The combination and application of automation
   and prefabrication technologies may therefore introduce new developments
   to the construction industry. This paper provides a comprehensive review
   of the use of automation technology for structural prefabrication and
   construction, including recent developments, challenges and future
   trends. Five stages following the sequence of construction are proposed:
   design, construction management, robotic manufacturing, autonomous
   transportation and automatic structural assembly. The paper concludes
   that the widespread use of automation technology is preferable to
   structural prefabrication for construction, and that the design for
   robotic construction introduced through connection innovations may be
   beneficial as a means of avoiding complex operations and thus improving
   the efficiency of robotic assembly processes.},

Pages = {123-139},
Abstract = {Engineering design is one of the most in-demand Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) uses. Due to efforts required for modifying and
   preparing an imported model for analysis, the difficulty-to-benefit
   ratio is low in this BIM use. These preparations are more geared toward
   modifying an imported model based on the designer's interpretation of
   the building information model and including additional engineering
   information. Automating the interpretation and model transformation
   process can significantly facilitate information exchanges. The
   Interpreted Information Exchange (IIE) concept is developed in this
   study for such automation during model exchanges. A platform is
   developed and presented in this paper for implementation of this
   concept. The platform contains procedures and functionalities required
   for inputting, processing, and exporting IFC information models through
   automated interpretation processes that implement IIE concept. The
   platform is especially formulated to be schema-independent to make it
   compatible with any standard or custom-defined version of IFC.},

Abstract = {The study presents a sustainable building modernisation model that uses
   knowledge-based decision-making methods to general reconstruct old
   public buildings, intending to achieve the best level of energy use on
   the design scene. The rapid development and dissemination of standards
   cause multiple research opportunities in the fields of process
   automation and adaptation of BIM technologies to the prerequisites of
   existing buildings. Decision-making was widely supported by imitating
   structures used in the late stages of design. However, its application
   is not sufficient at the beginning, which affects design solutions with
   a significant impact on the performance of the completed building.
   Construction design is a multifaceted discipline where architects,
   engineers, contractors, and builders influence design decisions. This
   modernisation way uses digital systems and simulations to estimate the
   expected energy consumption of construction faster and economically. BIM
   and critical characteristics are the basis of the model, where design
   and general processing needs to follow to pre-built instructions. This
   solution allows estimating energy demand in reconstructed buildings and

Title = {Intelligent question and answer system for building information modeling
   and artificial intelligence of things based on the bidirectional encoder
   representations from transformers model},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In recent years, building information modeling and artificial
   intelligence of things (BIM-AIOTs) in the con-struction industry have
   gained much attention. Construction engineers and researchers learn
   about BIM-AIOT and increase their professional knowledge through
   internet searches. However, the large amount of informa-tion on the
   internet makes it difficult to find specific information. Although some
   previous work of BIM-related searches exists, most still search with a
   combination of keywords or longer terms. This paper utilizes a machine
   learning model with natural language processing (NLP) technique of
   bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)
   integrated with a mobile chatbot as a question and answer (QnA) system.
   The dataset used for modeling contained 3334 text paragraphs that
   shortened to 10,002 questions. The result shows an F1 score of around
   65\% accuracy, which is acceptable for model prediction. Then, the
   system verifies to synchronize to the server and user interface. The
   system works well for information search and offers a supporting
   automation information system in the construction industry. This study
   achieved conversational machine understanding and a user-friendly
   BIM-AIOT integration information searches platform. The proposed system
   has a reliable research-based information source. It is verified as an
   effective and efficient way to produce fast decision-making. The system
   is deemed a future application for research-based problem-solving
   solutions in Architecture, Engi-neering, and Construction (AEC).},

Title = {A BIM-Based Framework for Managing Handover Information Loss},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Number = {5},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The construction project information for FM team control and maintenance
   is vital. However, current practices indicate significant data drops
   during the handover stage, leading to rework during FM systems
   integration of inaccurate, delivered information. Although challenges in
   BIM implementation are well studied, there is a current lack of best
   practices from FM industry experts highlighting challenges with a
   specific focus on the areas of the data drop. Therefore, the aim is to
   develop a framework that can reduce data loss and improve data
   management. The objectives include robust literature review on
   challenges of information loss during handover phase, management and
   frameworks; Adopting case study and workshops to identify information
   loss challenges, framework development and validation with industry
   experts. This paper adopted a grounded theory approach to explore
   literature and conducted case studies, including a series of
   semistructured interviews and a workshop with FM industry experts. The
   findings show the areas and causes of information loss and how to manage
   them through the developed information loss management framework (ILMF).
   With the start of any type of project, planning and establishing rules
   from the beginning facilitates the smooth transition between different
   phases. Similarly, in construction projects, this research provides
   guidelines on how facility managers can manage information loss when
   exchanged through projects' stages. Furthermore, with the continuing
   advancements in the construction world, the facility management should
   be equipped with management and leadership guidelines as presented in
   the proposed framework to reduce data loss during handover. However,
   there are cost and contractual issues that prohibit any involvement of
   the facility manager in early project stages. The results of this study
   provide an identification of professional practices do's and do not's
   that facilitate the management and development of projects with the
   support of the latest technologies in the market. Ultimately, developing
   a guide that adapts international standards. The study's contribution to
   knowledge includes the development of a new information loss management
   framework that adopts BIM and ISO standards after exploring the existing
   data management frameworks in the literature that lack data loss
   management as a focus. The framework works as a guide for various
   stakeholders such as designers, contractors with a focus on FM to
   facilitates data coordination and management to reduce information loss,
   its creation and validation were conducted in collaboration with
   industry experts. Furthermore, its novelty lies in integrating FM role,
   information management, information loss, address project life cycle,
   and adopts the ISO 19650 series.},

Title = {Live semantic data from building digital twins for robot navigation:
   Overview of data transfer methods},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {56},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Increasing reliance on automation and robotization presents great
   opportunities to improve the management of construction sites as well as
   existing buildings. Crucial in the use of robots in a built environment
   is their capacity to locate themselves and navigate as autonomously as
   possible. Robots often rely on planar and 3D laser scanners for that
   purpose, and building information models (BIM) are seldom used, for a
   number of reasons, namely their unreliability, unavailability, and
   mismatch with localization algorithms used in robots. However, while BIM
   models are becoming increasingly reliable and more commonly available in
   more standard data formats (JSON, XML, RDF), they become more promising
   and reliable resources for localization and indoor navigation, in
   particular in the more static types of existing infrastructure (existing
   buildings). In this article, we specifically investigate to what extent
   and how such building data can be used for such robot navigation. Data
   flows are built from BIM model to local repository and further to the
   robot, making use of graph data models (RDF) and JSON data formats. The
   local repository can hereby be considered to be a digital twin of the
   real-world building. Navigation on the basis of a BIM model is tested in
   a real world environment (university building) using a standard robot
   navigation technology stack. We conclude that it is possible to rely on
   BIM data and we outline different data flows from BIM model to digital
   twin and to robot. Future work can focus on (1) making building data
   models more reliable and standard (modelling guidelines and robot world
   model), (2) improving the ways in which building features in the digital
   building model can be recognized in 3D point clouds observed by the
   robots, and (3) investigating possibilities to update the BIM model
   based on robot feedback.},

Title = {Development of BIM-Based Risk Rating Estimation Automation and a
   Design-for-Safety Review System},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Various laws and guidelines on designing for safety have been developed
   world-wide, and these were used to identify risks at construction sites
   in advance through qualitative and quantitative safe management. In
   other words, attention is being paid to safe management based on design
   drawings and models rather than field visits. It was predicted that the
   introduction of the concept of design-for-safety would minimize risk at
   construction sites through safe management in the design phase. This is
   because the efficiency and reliability of such a strategy has been
   demonstrated in various cases abroad. However, domestic
   design-for-safety suggests a very limited range of evaluation items, so
   there is a limit to using such strategies in construction sites.
   Building information modeling (BIM) technology is attracting attention
   in situations when safe management must also be based on design
   proposals. Although previous studies on the identification of falling
   disasters and automatic identification of hazards have been conducted,
   these studies only deal with a limited range of items for identifying
   risk items. For example, BIM-based risk extraction, which is limited to
   falling disasters, is only at the level of risk recognition that can be
   derived based on the process table, and evaluation is not made
   accordingly. It is difficult to assess the overall disaster risk in many
   of the items required for risk rating estimation. In this paper, we
   solve the above problems by deriving a BIM-based risk rating estimation
   scenario based on the disaster scenario for automating BIM-based risk
   rating estimation, and we developed an evaluation system using this
   method. The BIM-based risk rating estimation methodology was presented
   through BIM-based hazard extraction, evaluation of requirement
   information, evaluation item selection, and using the evaluation system
   in a design-for-safety review.},

Abstract = {With the shortage of skilled labors, there is an increasing demand for
   automation in the construction industry. This study presents an
   autonomous construction framework for crane control with enhanced soft
   actor-critic (SAC-E) algorithm and real-time progress monitoring. SAC-E
   is a novel reinforcement learning algorithm with superior learning speed
   and training stability for lifting path planning. In addition, robotic
   kinematics and a control algorithm are implemented to ensure that the
   crane can autonomously execute the lifting path. Last, novel hardware
   communication interfaces between robot operating system and building
   information modeling (BIM) are developed for real-time construction
   progress monitoring. The performance of the proposed framework was
   demonstrated using a robotized mobile crane to stack concrete retaining
   blocks. The results show that the proposed framework can be effectively
   used to execute the retaining block construction using the robotized
   mobile crane with real-time construction update in the BIM platform.},

Title = {Digital twin-enabled built environment sensing and monitoring through
   semantic enrichment of BIM with SensorML},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Effective environmental condition monitoring provides constant
   surveillance of the built environment and re-veals deteriorations that
   could impact the daily operation of facilities, especially amid COVID
   situations. However, the current Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data
   schema for Building Information Modelling (BIM) provided limited support
   to represent full semantics related to environmental sensing and
   monitoring. How to semantically enrich the IFC schema with enhanced data
   description capability for informed decision-making in smart facilities
   management (FM) amid COVID situations remains an open question. This
   paper develops a semi-automatic extension and integration of IFC data
   schema with Sensor Model Language (SensorML) specification in order to
   support automated built environment sensing and monitoring. Referring to
   SensorML, an extended IFC model view definition for a comprehensive
   description of required sensor metadata and sensing entities is
   presented. An Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network is then
   established to realise continuous data collection from a variety of
   wireless sensing devices. The spatial-temporal data captured by the IoT
   sensor network are extracted by a regular expression-based data
   distillation algorithm and integrated with the digital twin, in which
   spatial interpolation algorithms further analyse, compute, and visualise
   the state of the environment. The pro-posed method is demonstrated via
   an experimental study which supports real-time environmental monitoring
   and delivers more actionable insights to facility managers to sustain
   the daily operation of buildings. This study contributes new methods and
   models to semantically enrich the digital twin from the data perspective
   for environmental condition monitoring during the pandemic time which
   fosters the development of holistic building facility management.},

Title = {BIM to BREEAM: A workflow for automated daylighting assessment of
   existing buildings},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {312},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {By conducting an assessment of the existing building stock from the
   perspective of the Green Building Certification System (GBCS), it is
   possible to contribute to the improvement of energy utilization and
   reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as promoted through the Renovation
   Wave strategy by the European Union. These aspirations will
   simultaneously contribute to enhancing human well-being, indoor
   environmental quality, and comfort. This paper describes a novel
   methodology for enhancing the renovation of existing buildings at the
   design stage using automation within the Building Information Modeling
   (BIM) environment. By parameterizing the requirements of GBCS using a
   visual programming tool, real-time insight into the number of achieved
   certain issue credits in the certification process is enabled. It was
   also created to enable designers in the Architecture, Engineering,
   Construction, and Operations (AECO) sector to continuously monitor the
   development of design and make modifications as early as possible in the
   design process. Thus, cost overruns in design projects, as well as later
   renovations and building maintenance, are prevented. This research has
   utilized the capability of BIM to perform rapid compliance simulations
   with Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method
   (BREEAM) requirements without the need for manual calculations and/or
   computer simulations in other software, which would increase the time
   required for analysis due to additional modeling requirements. The
   methodology is demonstrated using the automation of the Daylighting
   section of the issue Hea01 Visual Comfort from the Technical Manual
   SD225 1.4 - BREEAM International Non -Domestic Refurbishment 2015, and
   the validation was performed on a BIM model of an existing building
   belonging to the educational sector. The application of the described
   methodology in the case study reduced the time required for assessing
   the number of achieved daylighting credits by 40\%, with potential
   savings extending up to 80\% depending on the chosen criteria for
   analysis. The tool is designed to be applicable to other GBCS, building
   types, and newly designed buildings as well.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {163},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) plays a pivotal role in the
   construction management of dam engineering projects, which face
   challenges in data interoperability due to the absence of standardized
   data formats. While Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) offer a
   standardized digital representation of the built environment, it lacks
   the capability to accurately model the semantics of roller -compacted
   concrete dams. Therefore, this paper presents an extended IFC-based
   information exchange for the construction management of roller
   -compacted concrete dams, incorporating the development and validation
   of a prototype through a case study. The results indicate a significant
   enhancement in standardized information exchange for construction
   management compared to traditional practices. The approach facilitates
   BIM -assisted information exchange automation among stakeholders
   involved in roller -compacted concrete dam construction projects. The
   findings of this study provide valuable insights into dam construction
   management system prototyping and cross -platform collaboration.},

Title = {Integrated building information modeling and blockchain system for
   decentralized progress payments in construction projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 9},
Abstract = {Purpose - The debate around automation through digital technologies has
   gathered traction in line with the advancement of Industry 4.0.
   Blockchain-powered construction progress payment has emerged as an area
   that can benefit from such automation. However, the challenges inherent
   in real-time construction payment processes cannot be solely mitigated
   by blockchain. Including building information modeling (BIM)-based
   schedule information stored in decentralized storage linked with a smart
   contract (SC) can allow the efficient administration of payments.
   Accordingly, this study aims to present an integrated BIM-blockchain
   system (BBS) to administer decentralized progress payments in
   construction projects. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed-method
   approach is adopted, including an extensive literature review,
   development of the integrated BBS, and a case study with 13 respondents
   to test and validate the BBS. This study proposes a BBS that extracts
   the invoices from BIM and pushes them to the decentralized app (dApp)
   for digital payment to the contractor through the Ethereum blockchain.
   The Solc npm package was used to compile the backend SC. Next.js was
   used to create the front end of the dApp. The Web3 npm package is
   paramount in developing a dApp. A total of 13 construction professionals
   working on the case study project were engaged through a questionnaire
   survey to comment on and validate the proposed BBS. A descriptive
   analysis was conducted on the case study data to apprehend the responses
   of expert professionals. Findings - The proposed BBS creates an SC,
   enables sender verification, checks contract complaints, verifies bills,
   and processes the currency flow based on a coded payment logic. After
   passing the initial checks, the bill amount is processed and made
   available for the contractor to claim. Every activity on dApp leaves its
   trace on the blockchain ledger. A control mechanism for accepting or
   rejecting the invoice is also incorporated into the system. The case
   study-based validation confirmed that the proposed BBS could increase
   payment efficiency (92.3\%), tackle financial misconduct (84.6\%),
   ensure transparency and audibility (92.4\%), and ensure payment security
   (61\%) in construction projects. A total of 46.2\% of respondents were
   skeptical of the BBS because of its dependency on cryptocurrencies. A
   further 23.1\% of respondents indicated that the price fluctuation of
   cryptocurrencies is a major barrier to BBS adoption. Others highlighted
   the absence of legal frameworks for cryptocurrencies' usage.
   Originality/value - This study opens the avenue for the application of
   dApp for autonomous contract management and progress payments, which is
   flexible with applications across various construction processes.
   Overall, it is a potential solution to the endemic problem of cash flow
   that has devastating consequences for all project stakeholders. This is
   also aligned with the goals of Industry 4.0, where process automation is
   a key focus. The study provides a practice application for automated
   progress payments that can be leveraged in construction projects across
   the globe.},

Abstract = {Prefabricated construction is spreading widely for its various
   advantages like construction efficiency, quality assurance, and
   environmental protection. However, ensuring project cost-effectiveness
   under the ever-increasing demands of prefabrication rate requirements
   has become a challenge. There is a growing need for Quantity Take-off
   (QTO) feedback on building components for stakeholders in the initial
   stages of structural design. This paper aims to create an automated
   design-feedback workflow for the structural QTO using the BIM-assisted
   visual programming tool Dynamo. The workflow includes model
   construction, data analysis, unit price data encoding, and design
   automation. The proposed method demonstrates the pattern of data
   exchange between stakeholders and is automated by the created visual
   programming scripts, breaking the original technical limitations, and
   presenting timely QTO feedback to the clients in a straightforward
   format. This study contributes to the field of design communication

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {284},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The revolution of the industry 4.0 presents a new era of digital
   transformation for the construction indus-try, advancing towards the
   concept of digital twins, while on the other hand it faces the global
   challenge of reducing carbon emissions from operational assets. The
   current research gap in the application of dig-ital twins for achieving
   net zero were reviewed in this study, highlighting its potentials for
   enhancement in the built environment, and emphasizing the need for
   demonstration of a use-case analysis for its adop-tion by the industry.
   This research presents a digital twin solution to automate the
   monitoring and con-trolling of equivalent carbon dioxide (eCO2)
   emissions from existing assets through the integration of IoT, BIM, and
   artificial intelligence across a comprehensive solution, further
   validating its workability through a real-life use case analysis. The
   study revealed the significance of BIM and IoT, as essential components
   of a digital twin to visualise critical spatial information for enhanced
   facility management specifically for monitoring of indoor air quality of
   spaces, while also coalescing an AI-supported system to predict carbon
   emissions from the collected data through integration of machine
   learning features across the digital twin. The output of the entire
   solution is displayed as an interactive dashboard for observing trends
   and patterns, enabling stakeholders to implement effective data-driven
   retrofitting strategies. This research is a fundamental initiation for
   implementing digital twins to monitor emissions from existing assets, a
   step towards achieving the net zero targets.Crown Copyright (c) 2023

Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) is an appreciated technology in the
   field of architecture and construction management. Collaboration of
   information in BIM has not been fully utilized in the structural
   engineering stream as many engineers keep on working with previous
   prevailing design approaches. Failure to adequately facilitate
   automation in design could lead to structural defects, construction
   rework, or even structural clashes, with major financial implications.
   Given the inherent complexity of large-scale construction projects, the
   `manual design and detailing' of structure is a challenging task and
   prone to human errors. Against this backdrop, this study developed a 4D
   building information management approach to facilitate automated
   structural models for professionals designing all the elements required
   in reinforced concrete (RC) structures like slabs, beams, and columns.
   The main contribution of this study is to obtain structural models
   directly from architecture models automatically, which reduces effort
   and possible errors in the previous prevailing approaches. The framework
   enables execution of all the model design works automatically through
   coding. This is achieved by executing a script which is beneficial for
   integrated project delivery (IPD). The 3D structural model in BIM
   software presented in this study extracts and transfers the geometrical
   data and links these data in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) files
   using integration facilitated by Python 3.6 and IFCopenshell. The
   developed automated programme framework offers a cost-effective and
   accurate methodology to address the limitations and inefficiencies of
   traditional methods of structural modelling, which had been carried out
   manually. The authors have developed a novel tool to extract structural
   models from architectural models without proprietary software, greatly
   benefiting BIM managers by enhancing 3D BIM models. This advancement
   toward Open BIM, crucial for the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry's future, is accessible to educators and
   beginners and highlights BIM's effectiveness in improving structural
   analysis and productivity. The core finding of this study is to generate
   a structural model from an architecture model by automating the script
   with Python integration of IFC and IFCopenshell. The merits of the
   developed framework are reduced clashes, more economical structural
   modelling, and fully automated smart work as functions of the IPD.},

Title = {OSD A framework for the early stage parametric optimisation of the
   structural design in BIM-based platform},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-169},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The paper aims to leverage the importance of the integrated automatic
   structural design for tall buildings at the early stage. It proposes to
   use an automatic prototype to perform the structural design, analysis
   and optimisation in a building information modelling (BIM)-based
   platform. This process starts with extracting the required information
   from the architectural model in Revit Autodesk, such as boundary
   conditions and designs different options of the structural models in
   Robot Autodesk. In this process, Dynamo for Revit is used to define the
   mathematical functions to use different variables and generate various
   structural models. The paper aims to expand the domain of automation in
   the BIM platform to reduce the iterative process in different areas such
   as conceptual structural design and collaboration between architects and
   structural engineers to reduce the time and cost at the early stages.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper begins with an exploratory research by adopting a qualitative
   methodology and using open-ended questions to achieve more information
   about the phenomenon of automation and interoperability between
   structural engineers and architects and gain new insight into this area.
   Furthermore, correlation research is used by adopting quantitative and
   short questions to compare the proposed prototype with the traditional
   process of the structural design and optimisation and the
   interoperability between architects and engineers and consequently,
   validate the research.
   Findings
   As an outcome of the research, a structural design optimisation (SDO)
   prototype was developed to semi-automate the structural design process
   of tall buildings at the early stages. Moreover, the proposed prototype
   can be used during the early stage of structural design in different
   areas such as residential buildings, bridges, truss, reinforced concrete
   detailing, etc. Moreover, comprehensive literature regarding using
   automation in structural design, optimisation process and
   interoperability between architects and engineers is conducted that
   provides a new insight to contribute to future research and development.
   Research limitations/implications - Due to the time limit, the paper
   results may lack in a comprehensive automatic structural design process.
   Therefore, the researchers are encouraged to expand the workability of
   the prototype for a comprehensive automatic design check such as
   automatic design for the minimumdeflection, displacement of different
   types of buildings. Practical implications - The prototype includes
   implications for the development of different automatic designs.
   Originality/value
   The focus of this paper is the optimisation of the structural design in
   the BIM platform by using automation. This combination is one of the
   novelties of this paper, and the existing literature has a very limited
   amount of information and similar work in this area, especially
   interoperability between architects and engineers.},

Title = {Effects of Automation and Transparency on Human Psychophysiological
   States and Perceived System Performance in Construction Safety
   Automation: An Electroencephalography Experiment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},

Abstract = {Automation technology has experienced explosive growth in recent
   decades. However, the construction industry, let alone the field of
   construction safety, is still among the least digitized globally.
   Although many types of automation have proven effective in enhancing
   productivity and accuracy, adoption and acceptance by construction
   professionals are still limited. Human factors are essential for the
   success of automation. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of
   different levels of system automation and transparency, and their
   interactions, on human states (trust, mental workload, situational
   awareness) and perceived performance (explainability, satisfaction,
   usability). An experiment was conducted using a tool to assess
   scaffolding design safety with varying automation and transparency
   levels. A between-group design was adopted in which participants were
   assigned to four groups (a 2x2 matrix of automation and transparency).
   In a multi-methods approach, human states were measured through
   questionnaires and electroencephalography, and system performance was
   measured through a questionnaire. The results indicated that (1)
   automation level does not have significant impact on human states or
   perceived system performance, (2) a highly transparent automation system
   is associated with significantly higher trust and better perceived
   system performance, and (3) the positive impacts of transparency tend to
   be more obvious in low-automation systems. Due to perceived complexity,
   one might think that transparency would be emphasized more in highly
   automated systems. However, the results of this study shed light on the
   importance of providing a highly transparent interface for explaining
   system logic in all automated systems for design safety assessment in
   construction, particularly those with low automation levels.},

Title = {Development of a framework to track life safety levels of occupants in
   the event of a fire in buildings},
Journal = {ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING AND DESIGN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 12},
Abstract = {In the operational phase of buildings, tracking what modifications can
   have an impact on the expected facility performances through manual
   checks can be impractical, albeit very important from a facility
   management perspective. The transition from the traditional prescriptive
   method towards the performance-based approach for building design and
   management may facilitate quantitative assessment of performances and
   may lead to conscious decisions which includes preparedness in the event
   of emergencies. The main goal of this paper is to develop a framework,
   compliant with a Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment, to
   track fire safety performance levels, in terms of life safety of
   occupants. As long as this is done through the definition of Key
   Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are being tracked continuously,
   facility managers can have a comprehensive and updated overview of
   current performances of a facility. More specifically, a single
   representative KPI was set and evaluated for several fire scenarios,
   using a set of simulation and data management tools. The results of the
   assessment were processed and transformed into a visual representation,
   referenced to a grid superimposed over the building layout to
   quantitatively represent the safety of occupants at every point of the
   building. The results were then sent back and displayed into the BIM
   model, for seamless accessibility by facility managers. The proposed
   methodology was tested on a pilot building, assuming two fire scenarios.
   This approach enabled supervision of a building's compliance with fire
   safety requirements, in terms of occupants' life safety, throughout the
   building lifecycle.},

Abstract = {A reasonable tunnel construction scheme is the key to preventing tunnel
   accidents and reducing cost waste. Aiming at a series of problems such
   as geological uncertainty, blindness of the construction scheme, and
   abstraction of construction data faced by tunnel construction, this
   paper uses building information modelling (BIM) technology, the Internet
   of things (IoT) technology, and particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   algorithm to establish an integrated intelligent system framework for
   tunnel information feedback construction. The idea of integration of
   this platform is introduced first. Furthermore, BIM tunnel IFC extension
   information integration technology, improved tunnel multi-information
   monitoring IoT technology, back-analysis of surrounding rock parameters,
   and optimization of the construction scheme based on PSO were discussed
   in detail. The tunnel construction feedback analysis process is proposed
   on this platform. The integrated system framework is applied to the
   construction of the Zhenfengling tunnel in Jilin Province, China,
   demonstrating that the proposed intelligent integration framework is
   effective. The IoT monitoring and the BIM information integration
   functions are feasible. Feedback analysis of anchoring parameters is
   fast and accurate. This platform integrates the advantages of multiple
   current technologies, reflects the trend of intelligence, visualization,
   and automation in tunnel information construction, and is of great
   significance for the advancement of digital and intelligent tunnel
   construction technology. The results of the anchoring parameters provide

Title = {An openBIM Approach to IoT Integration with Incomplete As-Built Data},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Featured Application
   The proposed methodology has been developed to support the Asset
   Management (AM) decision making according to an open Building
   Information Modelling (openBIM) approach. Within the context of the West
   Cambridge Digital Twin Research Facility, a real case scenario has been
   considered, where the as-built data is imprecise or absent. The
   methodology is well suited to dealing with incomplete data on existing
   buildings, when the objective is integration among AM, the Internet of
   Things (IoT) and BIM information.
   Digital Twins (DT) are powerful tools to support asset managers in the
   operation and maintenance of cognitive buildings. Building Information
   Models (BIM) are critical for Asset Management (AM), especially when
   used in conjunction with Internet of Things (IoT) and other asset data
   collected throughout a building's lifecycle. However, information
   contained within BIM models is usually outdated, inaccurate, and
   incomplete as a result of unclear geometric and semantic data modelling
   procedures during the building life cycle. The aim of this paper is to
   develop an openBIM methodology to support dynamic AM applications with
   limited as-built information availability. The workflow is based on the
   use of the IfcSharedFacilitiesElements schema for processing the
   geometric and semantic information of both existing and newly created
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) objects, supporting real-time data
   integration. The methodology is validated using the West Cambridge DT
   Research Facility data, demonstrating good potential in supporting an
   asset anomaly detection application. The proposed workflow increases the
   automation of the digital AM processes, thanks to the adoption of
   BIM-IoT integration tools and methods within the context of the

Title = {Toward efficient and agent-scalable indoor pathfinding: intelligent
   navigation-ability-driven indoor map generation using building
   information model},
Journal = {ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING AND DESIGN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 6},
Abstract = {Pathfinding is key in fields like robotics, automation, and
   computer-aided design. Indoor maps, crucial for pathfinding, are
   typically generated using Building Information Modeling (BIM). However,
   current methods are often tailored to specific agents, like pedestrians
   or vehicles, limiting their adaptability. This approach requires new map
   generation methods each time a new type of navigation agent, such as
   indoor robots, is introduced. As more smart building robots emerge,
   there's a growing need for scalable indoor map generation schemes. This
   study proposes an agent-scalable indoor map generation scheme and an
   efficient pathfinding algorithm using BIM data. First, an indoor
   navigation ability model is created to represent the occupation spaces
   and movement capabilities of navigation agents. Second, a
   navigation-ability-driven indoor map generation scheme is designed,
   using BIM data to create voxel-based passable areas and continuous span
   areas, ensuring scalability and universality. This results in a simple
   polygon outline and indoor triangular map. Third, an efficient
   pathfinding scheme is developed to navigate these generated indoor maps.
   Finally, experiments are conducted on various BIM models and agents.
   Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is adaptable to
   various agents and scales for those with different navigation abilities.
   The pathfinding algorithm finds the shortest path in an average of 0.4 s
   in a one-floor shopping plaza covering over 40,000 m(2). The scalability
   of this indoor map generation scheme allows new indoor navigation agents
   to access customized maps based on their navigation parameters, paving
   the way for more intelligent applications in smart buildings.},

Title = {Advancing BIM and game engine integration in the AEC industry:
   Innovations, challenges, and future directions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {The integration of building information modelling (BIM) with real-time
   game engines (GEs) promises to transform the Architecture, Engineering,
   and Construction (AEC) industry by enhancing design processes,
   streamlining construction workflows, and fostering more effective
   stakeholder collaboration. To understand the status of BIM and GE
   integration, this study employs a mixed-method approach by combining
   meta-analysis and meta-synthesis to assess the current state of BIM and
   GE integration. Drawing on data from academic databases such as Scopus
   and Web of Science, it classifies applications into key domains (e.g.
   design visualization, modular construction workflows, and real-time
   simulation) and examines the technologies, workflows, and evolving
   trends. The findings demonstrate that integration notably improves
   productivity, decision-making, and collaboration, yet widespread
   adoption remains hindered by persistent challenges, including
   interoperability barriers, high implementation costs, scalability
   constraints, and limited exploration of emerging technologies, such as
   generative AI, robotics, and reinforcement learning. Overcoming these
   issues is crucial to realizing the full potential of BIM-GE integration.
   Building on these insights, this paper proposes a future research
   agenda, encouraging the development of standardized integration
   protocols, more intuitive user interfaces, and advanced interoperability
   solutions. It also advocates for incorporating extended reality,
   automation, and other advanced technologies to support real-time,
   scalable, and collaborative environments. While this work provides a
   robust foundational resource for both researchers and industry
   practitioners, it acknowledges certain limitations, such as a reliance
   on academic literature and a greater emphasis on methodological aspects
   over practical implementations.},

Title = {AN OPEN AND STANDARDS-COMPLIANT PLATFORM FOR PRODUCT DATA TEMPLATES IN
   DIGITAL CONSTRUCTION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {30},
Abstract = {Construction digitalization faces persistent data management and
   interoperability challenges. Although ISO 19650 streamlines Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) processes, the lack of standardized data
   23386:2020) offer a structured framework for product data definition and
   exchange, addressing this issue by enhancing digital workflows
   consistency. This paper investigates the development of an open platform
   for the Portuguese construction industry to create, manage, and query
   PDTs in alignment with international standards. Key components include a
   PDT-compliant database, an interface for reviewing and downloading PDTs
   in digital formats, and an API gateway for integrating PDTs into BIM
   environments, and integration into buildingSMART data dictionary. The
   platform supports industry stakeholders by ensuring data consistency,
   traceability, and regulatory compliance. By providing machine-readable,
   interoperable data for seamless retrieval, it enhances data exchange and
   reduces inefficiencies in digital construction workflows. Developed as
   an open-source solution, the platform is designed for the Portuguese
   market but can be adapted for use in other regions, ensuring scalability
   and broader applicability. Future research could focus on a deeper
   integration with Common Data Environments, the Level of Information
   Need, and a Linked Data approach to further optimize structured data
   exchange and automation in BIM workflows.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Reverse engineering (RE) is a technology used to create
   three-dimensional (3D) models by scanning structures and can be used to
   examine the current condition of structures. Applying RE to the
   maintenance of railroad facilities with a high proportion of safety
   accidents can be an alternative to increase the efficiency of railroad
   facilities. However, most tasks while constructing Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) after 3D scanning and extracting two-dimensional (2D)
   drawings are still performed manually. In particular, denoising,
   registration, and 3D modeling based on point clouds are labor-intensive
   and time-consuming tasks, and their efficiency needs to be enhanced by
   introducing automation technology. In this study, we selected point
   clouds-based representative parameters for ballasted tracks of a
   straight single-line section for automating railroad maintenance. Scan
   data and a BIM of a ballasted track were compared using the selected
   representative parameters. In addition, the types of damage to ballasted
   track requiring maintenance were examined. And a testbed was consisted
   of ballasted a track was selected, and 3D scanning was performed to
   obtain point cloud data of a testbed. Then, a BIM model was created by
   measuring the numerical values corresponding to the representative
   parameters on the scan data. The feasibility of constructing a railroad
   maintenance BIM based on representative 3D object detection parameters
   during RE work on the ballasted track was evaluated.},

Title = {Challenges and opportunities for integrating BIM and LCA: Methodological
   choices and framework development},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The main objectives of this review are to identify the advanced
   strategies and research gaps in the integration of BIM-LCA approaches
   and to propose research opportunities for promoting the progress of
   BIM-based LCA. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was
   conducted. Considering the ISO standard framework for conducting LCA, we
   analyzed the published articles based on the type of input data, data
   exchanging process, output results, and method of storing environmental
   information. The results suggest that BIM-LCA research studies mostly
   focused on manual and semi-automatic solutions at the initial design
   phases, although there is a growing trend towards the automatic
   compilation of data exchange. Also, not all aspects of variations in the
   design have been addressed yet to enhance the validity of results and to
   complete the automation of the LCA process. Furthermore, there is an
   extensive area of opportunity for developing and integrating local LCA
   database following the level of development (LOD) models, integrating
   sensitivity analysis in the design process and, comparing different LODs
   to provide a guideline for early-stage decision-making concerning the
   construction phase results. The development of a comprehensive framework
   for assessing different sources of uncertainty and variability for
   BIM-LCA models seems necessary to achieve a robust decision on
   eco-friendly solutions.},

Abstract = {This research mainly discusses the characteristics of BIM architecture
   design and its application in traditional residential design from the
   perspective of smart cities. Given the topics that people are more
   concerned about, this research mainly uses BIM modeling technology to
   initially build a virtualized building model. It discusses the
   convenience of intelligent automation technology in terms of resource
   consumption and house security. In terms of safety, different levels of
   wind blowing strength are mainly used to measure the distance moved by
   the house to evaluate the safety factor. Divide the wind blowing
   intensity into A, B, C, D, E, F, and 6 levels to test the strength of
   the house. When the wind intensity level is F, the safety factor is the
   weakest, which is 20\%. When conducting a house consumption test,
   directly measure the house's electricity consumption within a specified
   time to conduct a resource rate consumption test. Divide the time period
   into 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 6 different time periods to measure
   power consumption. The resource consumption rate reaches a maximum value
   of 96\% when the length of time is 6 h. The experimental results show
   that the safety characteristics of BIM technology are the weakest when
   the wind strength level is F, and the safety performance is different
   when the wind strength level is different. In terms of resource
   consumption, the resource consumption rate reaches the maximum value
   when the time is 6 h, and the length of time directly determines the
   housing resource consumption rate. From the perspective of a smart city,
   BIM building design has the advantages of low resource consumption and
   high safety factor.},

Title = {Framework for Developing IFC-Based 3D Documentation from 2D Bridge
   Drawings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has been widely accepted in the
   industry and extensively used in supporting many construction tasks. In
   the government sector, the USDOT Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
   has implemented building information modeling (BIM) for bridge
   construction. Hence, state DOTs are now faced with heightened pressure
   in complying with the FHWA's Bridge Information Modeling (BrIM)
   standardization. Although BIM can provide many benefits to DOTs, current
   BIM-based platforms for bridges are not fully developed to process
   traditional two-dimensional (2D) bridge drawings for BIM-based
   computational tasks involving existing bridges, for example cost
   estimation. Bridges are a critical infrastructure in any nation's
   economy, and by law the DOTs are tasked with ensuring that they remain
   safe for use. To maintain bridges, engineers currently perform periodic
   inspections, assessing each part of the bridge to identify areas that
   require maintenance. Maintenance work items are then generated for these
   areas; these are usually computed traditionally or by systems that still
   rely heavily on manual inputs. Such processes are time-consuming and
   cumbersome, and depend on years of bridge technical expertise. To
   overcome these limitations and improve the accuracy of processes such as
   generating maintenance work items for bridges, we propose a framework
   for automatically (1) processing existing 2D bridge drawings for bridges
   built pre-BIM adoption in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry; (2) converting these record drawings into
   three-dimensional (3D) information models; and (3) converting 3D
   information models into industry foundation class (IFC) files. The
   developed 3D models using the proposed framework were compared against
   developed 3D models using the state-of-the-art method. Experimental
   results show that the developed framework can be used in developing
   algorithms that generate 3D models and IFC output files from portable
   document format (PDF) bridge drawings in a semiautomated fashion. The
   proposed method uses 3.33\% of the time it takes the current
   state-of-the-art method to generate a 3D model, and the generated models
   are of comparative quality.},

Title = {Evaluating the Performance of Campus Facility Management through
   Structural Equation Modeling Based on Key Performance Indicators},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {This paper presents the development of a comprehensive campus facility
   management performance assessment model (CFMPM). The model employs
   structural equation modeling (SEM) and incorporates a thorough list of
   crucial success factors. The CFMPM tool is intended for use by industry
   shareholders to evaluate the operational effectiveness of campus
   facility management (CFM) and analyze the proficiency and constraints of
   CFM organization across diverse managerial tiers. Key CFM success
   factors were collected using interviews with experts and relevant
   literature, validated using two rounds of the Delphi technique with 14
   highly qualified experts, and disseminated via an online questionnaire
   to industry experts who rated them according to their significance. Data
   were obtained from 402 participants hailing from diverse regions. Then,
   SEM was used to perform a quantitative analysis of the
   interconnectedness between the various aspects of CFM performance, with
   the aim of ascertaining the influence of each construct on overall
   performance. The model was rigorously assessed for its robustness across
   several parameters, including goodness-of-fit measurements, multivariate
   normality tests, and reliability and validity tests, in addition to
   hypothesis analysis. The gathered data were used to construct a CFMPM
   comprising 45 key performance indicators of successful CFM grouped into
   seven different constructs. The application of SEM revealed a noteworthy
   correlation between the operational indicators of proficient CFM and the
   construct groups, in addition to the impact of efficacious CFM
   constructs on CFM performance overall. This research enhances the
   existing knowledge base by identifying vital indicators for the
   evaluation of CFM effectiveness and utilizing them to formulate an
   inclusive global SEM capable of serving as a tool for gauging the
   efficiency of CFM. This could lend valuable support for organizations,
   facility managers, and policy makers when making well-informed
   decisions.},

Title = {3D reconstruction of building information models with weakly-supervised
   learning for carbon emission modelling in the built environment},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {377},
Number = {D},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Buildings and construction activities contribute around 38.0 \% of
   global CO2 emissions, emphasising the importance of carbon emission
   modelling in assessing the built environment's carbon footprint. For
   accurate carbon emission modelling, detailed as-built information on
   building structures is crucial, which is often challenged by
   uncertainties due to design modifications and construction variations.
   Scan-to-BIM technology mitigates this problem by capturing precise
   as-built geometries through point clouds and transforming them into
   detailed 3D digital models. However, traditional 3D modelling methods
   often rely on manual intervention in creating as-built BIM models, which
   leads to low accuracy and efficiency. This paper presents an AI-enhanced
   approach that employs weakly-supervised learning for automated BIM
   reconstruction, aiming at accurate carbon performance evaluation in the
   built environment. By employing weakly-supervised semantic segmentation,
   this approach segments structural components from 3D point clouds and
   formulates the topological relationships of building objects, which
   enhances the automation of BIM reconstruction. This ensures a detailed
   representation of dimensions and materials, facilitating effective
   carbon emission modelling. The results reveal marked improvements in
   both semantic segmentation and BIM model accuracy. Specifically, the
   WSSIS network demonstrates an OA of 99.42 \% and a mIoU of 98.27 \% for
   semantic segmentation. Moreover, over 80.0 \% of the point clouds meet
   the 5.0 mm tolerance requirements for BIM model accuracy. These BIM
   models are then used to assess the upfront carbon footprint of
   construction materials, as well as to model carbon emissions from usage
   to demolition. This method significantly enhances accuracy in evaluating
   and understanding the carbon impact within the built environment, and
   represents a noteworthy leap towards eco-friendly architectural and
   construction practices that aim to reduce carbon emissions.},

Title = {BIM framework for efficient material procurement planning},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {168},
Number = {A},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Inefficient procurement processes can lead to increased costs and
   project delays. Addressing information management inefficiencies is a
   significant but largely unexplored area within construction procurement
   strategies, despite potential for automation through Database Management
   Systems (DBMS) and Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). Subjective
   approaches constrain procurement planning, hindering optimal solutions.
   This paper addresses the gap by developing a comprehensive
   semi-automated procurement planning framework. The framework offers
   flexibility through a two-phased optimization employing Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) or Genetic Algorithm (GA), integrated with a Building
   Information Modeling (BIM)-driven database platform compatible with
   various modeling software. It enhances decision-making by considering
   indirect costs and allowing installment payments while generating a 4D
   schedule for improved supply chain stakeholder visualization and
   decision-making (e.g., project managers), demonstrating improvements
   over traditional procurement plans in a real-world case study. The
   developed framework enables future research on integrating real-time
   data, predictive analytics, and smart contracts to further enhance
   procurement management.},

Title = {Optimizing Rebar Process and Supply Chain Management for Minimized
   Cutting Waste: A Building Information Modeling-Based Data-Driven
   Approach},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Rebar procurement inefficiencies, such as inaccurate quantity estimation
   and misaligned delivery schedules, often lead to excessive waste, supply
   shortages, and project delays. While existing optimization methods
   reduce cutting waste, their effectiveness diminishes without integration
   into supply chain management (SCM). This study presents an integrated
   framework to optimize rebar processing and supply chain management (SCM)
   by leveraging Building Information Modeling (BIM) and data-driven
   optimization strategies. A 24-floor case study validated the approach,
   optimizing continuous main rebars into special lengths and combining
   discontinuous lengths into cutting patterns based on special lengths.
   Rebar orders were organized into 12 batches, each meeting a 15-ton
   minimum and requiring order placement at least two months in advance. An
   activity database integrated rebar optimization with the construction
   schedule, facilitating SCM analysis. BIM automation streamlined
   procurement by generating Bar Bending Schedules (BBSs) and synchronizing
   rebar tracking with real-time updates, improving coordination,
   efficiency, and project outcomes, particularly in high-rise building
   projects.},

Title = {Automated openBIM-based discrete event simulation modeling for
   cradle-to-site embodied carbon assessment},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {175},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Assessing cradle-to-site embodied carbon (EC) emissions enables
   stakeholders to make carbon-reduction decisions early. Discrete event
   simulation (DES) is useful for analyzing cradle-to-site EC by simulating
   construction operations. However, developing a DES model for
   cradle-to-site EC assessment in construction projects is timeconsuming
   and error-prone. Therefore, this paper proposes an automated
   openBIM-based DES modeling approach. It starts with developing an
   integrated ontology of EC assessment, building information modeling
   (BIM) elements, and DES modeling to identify data requirements. It is
   followed by a BIM data verification flow using open standards, including
   extending Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) files and checking data
   integrity in IFC. Lastly, a general IFC-to-XML conversion tool is
   developed to convert processed IFC inputs into XML files, enabling the
   automation of DES modeling for cradle-to-site EC assessment. This
   openBIM-based DES solution was demonstrated in an actual project
   building. The results indicate that our approach can significantly
   improve DES modeling efficiency.},

Title = {Developing systems-centric as-built BIMs to support facility emergency
   management: A case study approach},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {133},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Current as-built Building Information Model (BIM) deliverables generated
   following design and construction generally do not fulfill facility
   management needs. To provide total value to the facility owner, as-built
   models should be configured to provide needed critical operation and
   maintenance information, solve operational challenges, and improve
   safety and efficiency in various ways. In addition to having complete
   and accurate data, as-built BIMs should be configured to be
   systems-centric enabling facility owners to visualize model graphics
   from a systems perspective. This is critical during a maintenance
   emergency when the model user needs to identify components belonging to
   the building systems that are contributing to or impacted by the
   emergency and be able to make well-informed timely decisions. This paper
   contributes to the existing body of knowledge by defining and
   documenting requirements and procedures for configuring systems-centric
   as-built BIM models. A multi-level building systems classification is
   developed, and fourteen specific properties are defined. The
   implementation is discussed using a case study approach analyzing the
   mechanical and plumbing systems for a science and classroom building of
   a 4-year academic institution. By developing systems-centric models,
   facility staff can respond to emergency maintenance and analyze the
   impact of the event by isolating the elements of a specific system
   related to the emergency and display these elements explicitly.},

Abstract = {Despite the great potential of LPS and BIM to improve construction
   project productivity, the full integration of these modern production
   and information management systems at the data processing level is not
   yet achieved. After matching the literature to empirical studies in a
   Constructive Research Approach, it emerged that very few studies have
   investigated how buildings' data could be preserved and continuously
   evolve during the project lifecycle. Accordingly, we underline the
   potential role of data warehousing in rendering operational data as a
   strategic asset for decision making. These findings motivate the present
   research, which aims to capitalize on quantity surveying data in order
   to automate the generation of M \& E installation schedules. This paper
   first introduces the system functional requirements. Then, it proposes a
   conceptual scheme for the planning data mart (a data warehouse subset
   dedicated to planning subject area). Furthermore, we shed light on the M
   \& E fragnet standardization procedure and how data have been processed.
   Finally, we present the current software developments to demonstrate the
   feasibility of this concept.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This paper explores the current application status and development
   trends of intelligent construction technologies in modern timber
   structures in China. By using VOSviewer software for bibliometric
   analysis, the research focused on three key areas: BIM technology,
   machine vision, and lifecycle information management. The study found
   that BIM technology has significantly improved the design accuracy and
   construction efficiency of timber buildings through 3D visualization,
   parametric design, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Machine vision
   technology enhances the quality control and damage assessment efficiency
   through automation. Lifecycle information management promotes the
   sustainable development of timber buildings in line with carbon
   neutrality goals. The paper further analyzes the challenges and
   difficulties of applying intelligent construction technologies to modern
   timber structures and proposes the development of technology solutions
   tailored to the characteristics of timber structures, including
   deepening the integration with environmental science and urban planning
   and enhancing user feedback optimization. These studies provide new
   perspectives for the intelligent and low-carbon development of timber

Volume = {162},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {To address the challenges of low modeling efficiency and data loss in
   traditional methods, an automated numerical simulation analysis
   framework is proposed to enhance the safety simulation and control of
   complex underground engineering. This framework facilitates precise
   interaction between building information modeling (BIM) and finite
   element method (FEM) models while automating tasks like material
   property assignment, construction simulation, and high -quality mesh
   generation. Using this framework, the impact of the constructing a new
   shield tunnel beneath an existing tunnel is investigated based on actual
   cases. The settlement displacement simulated by the existing tunnel was
   compared with the monitoring results, verifying the reliability of the
   simulation analysis framework. It is demonstrated that the proposed
   framework achieves a simulation error 69.34\% lower than previous
   studies. The framework enhances the stability and integrity of
   information transmission, improves the efficiency of modeling and
   calculation, and provides new ideas for automated modeling and

Abstract = {Purpose The practice of facility management (FM) has been evolving with
   the rapid development of pervasive sensing technologies (PSTs) such as
   sensors, automatic identification (auto-ID), laser scanning and
   photogrammetry. Despite the proliferation of research on the use of PSTs
   for FM, a comprehensive review of such research is missing from the
   literature. This study aims to cover the knowledge void by examining the
   status quo and challenges of the selected PSTs with a focus on FM.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper reviewed 204 journal papers
   recounting cases of using PSTs for FM. The reviewed papers were
   extracted from Elsevier Scopus database using the advanced search.
   Findings Findings of this study revealed that PSTs and FM applications
   form a many-to-many mapping, i.e. one PST could facilitate many FM
   applications, and one application can also be supported by various PSTs.
   It is also found that energy modeling and management is the most
   referred purpose in FM to adopt PSTs, while space management, albeit
   important, received the least attention. Five challenges are identified,
   which include high investment on PSTs, data storage problem, absence of
   proper data exchange protocols for data interoperability, a lack of
   mature data processing methods for data utilization and privacy of
   users. Originality/value This paper paints a full picture of PSTs
   adoption for FM. It pinpoints the promising explorations for tackling
   the key challenges to future development.},

Abstract = {The construction industry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is a
   significant sector in the Middle East, with annual expenditures
   exceeding USD 120 billion. It employs 15\% of the workforce and consumes
   more than 14\% of the country's energy resources. Despite the
   significant growth in the Saudi construction sector, it faces various
   challenges due to the rapid launch of mega projects, such as the Line
   project engaged with the NEOM project, as well as other new projects as
   part of the Saudi Vision 2030. The challenges might be limited to a
   shortage of skilled labourers, rising costs, construction disputes, and
   material shortages. This study aims to investigate claims management
   procedures under traditional practice and compare them with a proposed
   BIM package as an alternative solution to mitigate construction
   disputes. The objective of the study focuses on reducing the time
   consumed when analysing claims against the level of accuracy of claims
   values. The proposed BIM model improves and streamlines the claims
   process through automation. This study presents prospective and
   retrospective methods in delay analysis under an accepted programme. A
   questionnaire survey was conducted, and out of a total of 123
   practitioners, 79 replied. The findings in tables in this article reveal
   that there are demands and a growing awareness of BIM in the KSA
   construction industry. The results reveal that BIM can help to reduce
   potential disputes and can reduce overall project cost overruns.},

Title = {Omni-Scan2BIM: A ready-to-use Scan2BIM approach based on vision
   foundation models for MEP scenes},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems play a crucial role
   in providing various services and creating comfortable environments for
   urban residents. In order to enhance the management efficiency of these
   highly complex MEP systems, as-built building information models (BIMs)
   are being increasingly adopted worldwide. As-built BIMs accurately
   represent the actual conditions of facilities, making as-built BIM
   reconstruction significantly important for construction progress
   tracking, quality assurance, subsequent facility management, and
   renewal. To create as-built BIMs for MEP systems, laser scanners are
   widely utilized to capture highresolution images and dense 3D
   measurements of the environment in a fast and highly accurate manner.
   Despite research efforts to automatically achieve ``Scan-to-BIM,{''}
   there are still gaps in applying current solutions to real-world
   scenarios. One of the major challenges are the limited generalization of
   existing methods to unseen scenarios without proper training or
   fine-tuning on custom-designed datasets. To address this issue, this
   study introduces Omni-Scan2BIM, a novel approach powered by large-scale
   pre-trained vision foundation models. Omni-Scan2BIM enables the
   recognition of MEP-related components with a single shot by integrating
   an allpurpose feature extraction model and a class-agnostic segmentation
   model. Firstly, given only a single image with a reference mask, the
   visual features are extracted for both the target component and the
   collected on-site images using the vision foundation model DINOv2.
   Secondly, through comparing pixel features, similarity maps are
   generated for the on-site images. The prior points for the
   class-agnostic segmentation model are sampled from the local maxima of
   the similarity map. Thirdly, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is leveraged
   to sequentially segment the target component. Finally, the target
   component is segmented out in 3D space based on the transformation
   matrix describing the spatial relationship between the 2D images and the
   3D point clouds. Shape analysis and label fusion are conducted for
   as-built BIM modeling purpose. To validate the feasibility of the
   proposed technique, experiments were conducted using data collected from
   a real construction site in Hong Kong. The results demonstrate that the
   proposed Omni-Scan2BIM approach can easily generalize to unseen
   components with significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {138},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is an integrated method that
   combines environmental, economic, and social assessments. Its
   methodological development remains under discussion, mainly regarding
   the building design. This paper aims to provide a systematic,
   interoperable, and open-source approach towards implementing LCSA in
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) in five steps. A harmonized data
   structure that enriches BIM objects is proposed. Automation in the
   principal evaluation step is provided by integrating new parameters into
   the current Industry Foundation Classes (IFC4). A Dynamo script verifies
   its utility in a case study in Spain using real-time calculations and
   visualizations. Two alternative structural systems are assessed, and
   identification is made of the lowest CO2 emitter, the lowest cost, and
   the most beneficial system for local employment. The approach can be
   employed to evaluate other indicators and building systems in other
   countries. Challenges and limitations in the standardization and
   harmonization of the three dimensions are identified.},

Abstract = {Daylight analysis and optimization are pre-requisites for
   energy-efficient and sustainable infrastructure. Conventional practices
   of designing and providing artificial lighting often ignore the
   consideration of the availability of natural daylight for the
   infrastructure. This paper aims to analyze the availability and
   potential of natural daylight reviewing the sky component type at a
   designated location, real-time sensor-based illuminance measurement
   on-site and BIM-based daylight simulation. Consequently, a sensor
   prototype was deployed to the metro rail station for automated
   optimization. Firstly, the sky component type of Ahmedabad was
   determined based on the literature review. Subsequently, sensors were
   integrated at the strategic grid point location covering the entire
   metro rail station to collect real-time Illuminance for daylight factor
   calculation. Furthermore, BIM-based sun path and shadow analysis and
   daylight simulation were carried out to suggest the possibility and
   potential of daylight savings. Finally, based on all the analysis and
   results, a newly designed sensor-based prototype was developed and
   equipped to enhance automated optimization for daylight savings, which
   resulted in 29\% energy savings monthly. This approach significantly
   helps the project stakeholders to enhance building energy performance

   BIM models for heritage digital twin},
Journal = {HERITAGE SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},

Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {This study focuses on the application of deep learning for transforming
   semantic point clouds into semantic Building Information Models (BIM) to
   create a Heritage Digital Twin, centering on Taoping Village, a site of
   historical and cultural significance in Sichuan, China. Utilizing
   advanced technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles and terrestrial
   laser scanning, we capture detailed point cloud data of the village. A
   pivotal element of our methodology is the KP-SG neural network, which
   exhibits outstanding overall performance, particularly excelling in
   accurately identifying 11 categories. Among those categories, buildings
   and vegetation, achieves recognition rates of 81\% and 83\%
   respectively, and a 2.53\% improvement in mIoU compared to KP-FCNN. This
   accuracy is critical for constructing detailed and accurate semantic BIM
   models of Taoping Village, facilitating comprehensive architecture and
   landscape analysis. Additionally, the KP-SG's superior segmentation
   capability contributes to the creation of high-fidelity 3D models,
   enriching virtual reality experiences. We also introduce a digital twin
   platform that integrates diverse datasets, their semantic information,
   and visualization tools. This platform is designed to support process
   automation and decision-making and provide immersive experiences for
   tourists. Our approach, integrating semantic BIM models and a digital
   twin platform, marks a significant advancement in preserving and
   understanding traditional villages like Taoping and demonstrates the
   transformative potential of deep learning in cultural heritage
   conservation.},

   Formwork},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this study, by applying the developed formwork automation design
   software to three target structures, we reviewed the applicability of
   the formwork automation design software for the aluminum formwork. To
   apply the formwork automation design software, we built an aluminum
   formwork library based on the conversion of two-dimensional (2D)
   computer-aided design (CAD) data to three-dimensional building
   information modeling data for all the components of the aluminum
   formwork. The results of the automated formwork layout on the target
   structures using the formwork automation design software confirmed that
   the wall and deck members were laid out by the set algorithm according
   to the formwork size and direction. However, because of the limited
   functionality of the software, the level of completion of the formwork
   layout was found to be lower than that of the manual formwork layout
   based on 2D CAD data. The currently developed software is based on a
   simple algorithm, but has a drawback in that the automated layout is
   limited to only some of its members. Therefore, additional research
   should be conducted on the development of advanced software through the
   diversification of the algorithm, automation of preprocessing of the
   mesh, and analysis of the relationships of all the members comprising
   the formwork.},

Abstract = {Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are an indispensable part of the UK
   society. In 2011, the Higher Education Funding Council for England set a
   carbon reduction target of 43\% by 2020, that most HEIs failed to meet.
   HEIs have a clear interest in improving student experience/comfort and
   their sustainability credentials. However, this research found that
   space management in HEI is clearly inefficient. This research represents
   the first phenomenological study in this field and identifies current
   practices in HEIs regarding their space/energy management. First, a
   traditional thematic literature review was completed, which found a
   clear gap on what data is collected and used to calculate the
   ventilation/heating/cooling by facilities managers at HEI. Then,
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with facilities management
   experts (n=10) based in HEIs. This study concludes that HEIs should
   calculate ventilation, heating and cooling loads working in geometry and
   real occupancy, as this will improve occupant comfort, enrich the
   student experience and increase energy efficiency. A building
   information modelling (BIM) platform could be adopted to integrate
   different systems so that building management systems (BMS) have
   enhanced access to time-sensitive space/energy data.},

   using BIM: a sustainable design approach},
Journal = {ENGINEERING RESEARCH EXPRESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {7},

Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) allows structures to be digitally
   designed and visualized before physical construction begins, effectively
   addressing and eliminating many inefficiencies and issues that typically
   arise during the construction process. This research evaluates the
   seismic design and energy consumption of Reinforced Concrete (RC)
   buildings using different BIM tools. The impact of different building
   configurations (including window-wall ratio, shading, and automation
   sensor effects) and orientation on the electrical energy consumption are
   evaluated. Integrating these factors into energy analysis can enhance
   conceptual design, leading to better environmental effectiveness and
   aiding in the achievement of environmental sustainability goals. The
   study determined that aligning the building at true north (zero
   degrees), using two-thirds window shade height, maintaining a 0\%
   window-wall ratio, and integrating day-lighting and occupancy sensors
   resulted in the most effective energy optimization outcomes.
   Optimization resulted in a reduction of overall energy consumption from
   975 MJ/m2/year to 729 MJ/m2/year, demonstrating that the BIM model is
   25\% more efficient than the actual building envelope. The sustainable
   design alternative achieves a 36.84\% savings in lifecycle energy costs.
   The findings accentuate the need for adopting passive designs to improve
   energy efficiency, cost, and sustainability.},

Title = {Automatic underground space security monitoring based on BIM},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {85-91},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Traditional underground space safety monitoring is ineffective as data
   continuity is weak, systematic and random errors are prominent, data
   quantification is difficult, data stability is scarce (especially in bad
   weather), and it is difficult to guarantee human safety. In this study,
   BIM technology and multi-data wireless sensor network transmission
   protocol, cloud computing platform are introduced into engineering
   monitoring, real-time online monitoring equipment, cloud computing
   platform and other hardware and software are developed, and
   corresponding online monitoring system for structural safety is
   developed to realize online monitoring and early diagnosis of
   underground space safety. First, the shape of the underground space, the
   surrounding environment, and various monitoring points are modeled using
   BIM. Then, the monitoring data collected from sensors at the engineering
   site are transmitted to the cloud via wireless transmission. Data
   information management is then realized via cloud computing, and an
   actual state-change trend and security assessment is provided. Finally,
   4D technology (i.e., 3D model + time axis) that leverages a deformation
   chromatographic nephogram is used to facilitate managers to view
   deformation and safety of their underground spaces. To overcome past
   shortcomings, this system supports the management of basic engineering
   project data and storage of historical data. Furthermore, the system
   continuously reflects the fine response of each monitoring item under
   various working conditions all day, which has significant theoretical
   value and application.},

Title = {Developing automated strategy of life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) with
   building information modeling (BIM) integration for building projects},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The construction industry plays a substantial role in the economic
   prosperity and growth of all other sectors in any country. To foster the
   economic sustainability of a construction project, it is crucial to
   evaluate all the associated current and future project costs. To address
   the current and future related costs to a project, life cycle cost
   analysis (LCCA) is the most sophisticated economic approach. However,
   traditionally, LCCA is performed manually, and thus, limited
   implementation is observed due to time-consuming and tedious steps. To
   address the issue, this current research attempts to automate the LCCA
   process and develop an advanced algorithm for LCCA with building
   information modelling (BIM) integration. Following the algorithm, an
   LCCA-BIM tool is developed using C\# programming language that automates
   the extraction of bills of quantities and facilitates the incorporation
   of cost data associated with a project with the LCCA parameter to
   determine life cycle cost. A case study was performed that validated the
   effectiveness of the algorithm in performing LCCA for a project.
   Integrating LCCA with BIM streamlines and automates the economic
   evaluation process and offers a robust framework for future advancement
   in LCCA implementation. The application leads to enhanced
   decision-making and encourages sustainability in building projects by
   eradicating barriers to retrieving and automating the LCCA.},

Title = {Sustainable Application of Hybrid Point Cloud and BIM Method for
   Tracking Construction Progress},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Compared to the past, the complexity of construction-project progress
   has increased as the size of structures has become larger and taller.
   This has resulted in many unexpected problems with an increasing
   frequency of occurrence, such as various uncertainties and risk factors.
   Recently, research was conducted to solve the problem via integration
   with data-collection automation tools of construction-project-progress
   measurement. Most of the methods used spatial sensing technology. Thus,
   this study performed a review of the representative technologies applied
   to construction-project-progress data collection and identified the
   unique characteristics of each technology. The basic principle of the
   progress proposed in this study is its execution through the point cloud
   and the attributes of BIM, which were studied in five stages: (1)
   Acquisition of construction completion data using a point cloud, (2)
   production of a completed 3D model, (3) interworking of an as-planned
   BIM model and as-built model, (4) construction progress tracking via
   overlap of two 3D models, and (5) verification by comparison with actual
   data. This has confirmed that the technical limitations of the
   construction progress tracking through the point cloud do not exist, and
   that a fairly high degree of progress data which contains efficiency and
   accuracy can be collected.},

Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Bridge maintenance activities benefit from digital models, provided in
   the interoperable IFC format. Such a model, enriched with up-to-date
   information, is an enabler for a wide range of applications. It opens
   new perspectives in asset information management. However, the manual
   creation of a digital replica, representing the actual state of the
   asset from point cloud data, is time-consuming. Consequently, process
   automation is of particular interest. This paper proposes a systematic,
   semi-automatic approach for creating IFC bridge models from point
   clouds. It introduces new methods for semantic segmentation and 3D shape
   modeling. A case study demonstrates the feasibility of the process in
   practice. Compared to other solutions, proposed methods are robust when
   dealing with incomplete point clouds.},

Title = {Development of a BIM and IoT-Based Smart Lighting Maintenance System
   Prototype for Universities' FM Sector},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Reactive maintenance (RM) is a core service of the operation and
   maintenance (O\&M) phase, the most prolonged and costly within the
   building lifecycle. RM is characterised by inefficient asset information
   and communication management, impacting critical FM problems and users'
   experience. Building information modelling (BIM) and Internet of things
   (IoT) has enabled the development of digital twins, moving facilities
   management (FM) from a reactive approach towards a predictive one.
   Although previous studies have investigated the application of such
   technologies to FM, there is a lack of understanding on procedural
   issues related to its implementation in FM and RM. This research aimed
   to characterise strategies and decisions involved in prototyping a BIM
   and IoT-based smart-lighting maintenance system and identify its
   potential impacts on universities' maintenance processes. The adopted
   research strategy and data collection methods involved prototyping,
   questionnaires, and interviews. The results show a high level of
   complexity in converging maintenance needs and technological abilities
   for FM and the importance of procedures and standards at organisational
   and industry levels. Moreover, it evidenced that the automation of
   functions and the centralisation of information enabled by BIM and IoT
   can optimise service provision, generate environmental and efficiency
   gains, and improve users' safety and satisfaction.},

Title = {An IDM-Based Approach for Information Requirement in Prefabricated
   Construction},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {Prefabricated construction promotes providing better productivity and
   project results. Building models, including their elements' fabrication
   details, are complex structures that need accurate information delivery
   among the project participants and their partial designs. This paper
   extends the IFC data model to support prefabricated construction. Also,
   it discusses the advantages of systematically managing exchange
   requirements in a database to facilitate generating IDM (Information
   Delivery Manual). The paper first introduces a BIM-based collaborative
   work mode by sharing and extracting the model views. The core of the
   sharing is the establishment of view exchange standard about the linked
   model and the definition of exchange requirements based on the design
   process, leading to the formulation of the IDM standard again from the
   perspective of the actual design. Process maps covering architecture,
   structure, plumbing, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering
   are made to show how to realize BIM-based collaborative work. Then the
   exchange requirements referred to the object and attribute of the BIM
   model which should be delivered in a special phase are defined in
   particular tables. To facilitate the automation of managing and
   exchanging requirements, a database management system is designed with
   its corresponding user-interface, which enhances the collaboration and
   delivery throughout the project life cycle. The proposed approach
   supports better information reuse and delivery among the project
   participants.},

Abstract = {Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) is the use of integrated
   multi-disciplinary performance models of design-construction projects to
   support explicit and public business objectives. Professor Levitt's
   Virtual Design Team (VDT) project provided a fundamental point of
   departure of this work: the organisation model provides a central
   theoretical and practical element in the VDC framework. VDC models are
   virtual because they are computer-based descriptions of the project.
   This paper summarises the VDC framework that integrates an organisation
   perspective with perspectives that are implicit in VDT, including 3D
   Building Information Model (BIM) product models of a product to be
   designed, built and operated - typically a physical facility -
   management by objectives, Lean production management and the social
   method of Integrated Concurrent Engineering (ICE). Thus, VDC project
   models emphasise those aspects of the project that can be designed and
   managed, i.e., the product (typically a building or plant facility), the
   organisation that will define, design, construct and operate it, and the
   process that the organisation teams will follow. Many companies and
   hundreds of professionals now use VDC methods, and they consistently
   find that they improve project and business performance.},

Abstract = {Digitalisation of the construction industry is exposing it to
   cybersecurity risks. All phases of construction can be affected.
   Particularly vulnerable are information-intensive phases such as
   building design and building operation. Construction is among the last
   industries that are discovering its cybersecurity risks and can rely on
   frameworks developed for other contexts. In this paper, we evaluate the
   cybersecurity risks of the design phase of construction using the Cyber
   Assessment Framework from the National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC) of
   the UK. The goal of this study is twofold. First, to examine
   cybersecurity risks themselves, and second, to evaluate the
   applicability of the NCSC framework for construction to see if and how
   construction is specific. The analysis shows that the cybersecurity
   risks follow the information impact curve that has been motivating the
   introduction of Building Information Modelling (BIM). The framework is
   applicable but is weak in addressing the specifics of the construction
   industrial ecosystem, which involves a multitude of dynamically
   connected actors, their overlapping authorities, and conflicting
   motives. It is suggested that a specialized construction-related
   framework should be developed.},

Title = {Harnessing BIM with risk assessment for generating automated safety
   schedule and developing application for safety training},
Journal = {SAFETY SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {164},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The construction industry accounts for 24.20\% of all accidents in
   India, resulting in almost 75 accidents daily. Every construction job
   involves certain risk levels, often resulting in losses such as
   fatalities, compensation costs, man-hour loss, work delays, and
   ergonomic disorders in workers. Poor site safety management and
   hesitation towards adopting new methods and technologies often result in
   inefficient workflow, accidents, and inferior productivity. All these
   factors pile up, causing a surge in indirect costs, almost four times
   direct costs. The Indian construction industry employs 51 million
   workers but has only 4\% formally trained workforce. Safety planning is
   currently considered a `secondary' task due to insufficient safety
   budget, lack of well-defined training modules and modern tools,
   unawareness about underlying hazards, etc. The current study is an
   attempt to identify and assess underlying activity-based hazards using
   the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) approach by harnessing the
   potential of digital tools such as Building Information Modelling (BIM)
   and Visual Scripting in Dynamo v.2.10 to facilitate automation in
   generating `Safety Schedule' in coordination with the project schedule.
   This study presents a novel idea of proactive safety planning, enabling
   workers and managers to foresee possible hazards associated with ongoing
   activity. Further, a worker training tracker prototype is developed in
   Microsoft Visual Studio using C\# to store and track workers' safety
   training information. Managers can use this tracker to review workers'
   competence and ensure that they would have received appropriate
   role-based safety training. The applicability and effectiveness of the
   proposed method are demonstrated through a case study project.},

Title = {OBJECT-CENTRED AUTOMATED COMPLIANCE CHECKING: A NOVEL, BOTTOM-UP
   APPROACH},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {335-362},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is changing how built assets are
   delivered and operated. A built asset is represented as a set of
   objects, each with an identity, attributes, and relations. This
   object-oriented nature enables new approaches for ensuring compliance
   with a range of requirements: e.g. industry guidelines; project and
   client-specific requirements; and building codes and standards.
   Furthermore, bottom-up design approaches are known to be more suitable
   for quality control and design errors detection. Based on an adapted
   version of simulated annealing concept, this paper proposes an automated
   compliance checking classification and identifies a set of desired
   characteristics these methods should fulfil. It then demonstrates a
   bottom-up object-centred approach for automated model checking and the
   corresponding plugin prototype. The approach and the prototype enable
   four key processes and satisfy all desired characteristics of compliance
   checking methods including content validation, model completeness, smart
   object, and design option checking. To demonstrate the feasibility and
   accuracy of the approach, two case studies are processed using existing
   BIM objects libraries one of which is created by a major French
   manufacturer. All four steps were successfully completed, and the
   results show savings of around 125 minutes per object between the
   automated approach and traditional manual methods of working.},

Title = {Understanding quality of analytics trade-offs in an end-to-end machine
   learning-based classification system for building information modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIG DATA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},

Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Optimizing quality trade-offs in an end-to-end big data science process
   is challenging, as not only do we need to deal with different types of
   software components, but also the domain knowledge has to be
   incorporated along the process. This paper focuses on methods for
   tackling quality trade-offs in a common data science process for
   classifying Building Information Modeling (BIM) elements, an important
   task in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Due to
   the diversity and richness of building elements, machine learning (ML)
   techniques have been increasingly investigated for classification tasks.
   However, ML-based classification faces many issues, w.r.t. vast amount
   of data with heterogeneous data quality, diverse underlying computing
   configurations, and complex integration with industrial BIM tools, in an
   end-to-end BIM data analysis. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end ML
   classification system in which quality of analytics is considered as the
   first-class feature across different phases, from data collection,
   feature processing, training to ML model serving. We present our method
   for studying the quality of analytics trade-offs and carry out
   experiments with BIM data extracted from Solibri to demonstrate the
   automation of several tasks in the end-to-end ML classification. Our
   results have demonstrated that the quality of data, data extraction
   techniques, and computing configurations must be carefully designed when
   applying ML classifications for BIM in order to balance constraints of
   time, cost, and prediction accuracy. Our quality of analytics methods
   presents generic steps and considerations for dealing with such designs,
   given the time, cost, and accuracy trade-offs required in specific
   contexts. Thus, the methods could be applied to the design of end-to-end
   BIM classification systems using other ML techniques and cloud services.},

Title = {IDS Standard and bSDD Service as Tools for Automating Information
   Exchange and Verification in Projects Implemented in the BIM Methodology},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The era of openBIM is ongoing, and the open standards IDS (Information
   Delivery Specification) and bSDD (BuildingSMART Data Dictionary) are
   significantly impacting the automation of information exchange and
   verification in projects, using predefined data, enabling quick updates
   and combining it with other data. IDS and bSDD complement the widely
   used open IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) format, which solves the
   issue of purchasing both the appropriate hardware and software to work
   with native files from different sources. As a result, external
   assignments or internal tasks have the potential to precisely define the
   desired product, speeding up the entire process carried out according to
   the BIM (Building Information Modeling) methodology, reducing the number
   of questions about ambiguous requirements, and eliminating the need for
   continuous feedback on the model. Both files can be used on the
   developer's side as an attachment to BIM documents, as well as on the
   construction site or during the bidding process. Digital IDS and bSDD
   files can be interpreted not only by humans but also by machines,
   bringing added value and usability. An identified research gap is the
   lack of a clear procedure for applying the mentioned standards, and
   thus, the common problem of purchasing software to check the quality of
   the model for information content. This article demonstrates the
   possibility of creating IDS and bSDD files in tools based on filling in
   specific fields and their interrelation, as well as their practical use
   in the process of verifying the information content of BIM models. By
   adopting open standards, teams can improve communication, increase
   productivity, and ensure continuity in data exchanges.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is a process for managing the
   construction information model. The possibility of managing very complex
   construction orders using information processes has made the work of
   designers both easier and more productive. In this research, a new
   process of ``assisted design{''} was implemented for self-assembling
   temporary houses with high environmental sustainability. The developed
   procedure allows for the supporting of a nonexpert user in the
   configuration of housing modules, using the base elements, and assisting
   them until the energy verification process based on the place of
   installation. Furthermore, a lifecycle assessment of emissions is made
   available. This is the result of the interoperability of software
   enabled by using BIM logic. The proposed work contributes to enriching
   the range of technical solutions developed to meet the demand for
   temporary buildings, providing a valid support tool in the design phase,
   especially when it needs to be completed within a short timeframe. This
   study introduces a smart configuration procedure that combines aspects
   of project automation and flexibility with energy efficiency and
   environmental sustainability needs required for the green transition of

Title = {Linking data model and formula to automate KPI calculation for building
   performance benchmarking},
Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {1326-1337},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Buildings consume a large proportion of global primary energy and
   building performance management requires massive data inputs. Key
   Performance Indicator (KPI) is a tool used for comparing different
   buildings while avoiding problems caused by heterogeneous data sources.
   However, silos of building and energy consumption data are separate, and
   the linkages between a KPI formula and different data sets are often
   non-existent. This paper develops an ontology-based approach for
   automatically calculating the KPI to support building energy evaluation.
   The proposed approach integrates building information from BIM and
   energy and environmental information collected by sensor networks. A KPI
   ontology is developed to establish a KPI formula, thereby linking static
   and dynamic data generated in the building operation phase. Each KPI can
   be defined by inputs, a formula and outputs, and the formula consists of
   parameters and operators. The parameters can be linked to building data
   or transformed into a SPARQL query. A case study is investigated based
   on the proposed approach, and the KPIs for energy and environment are
   calculated for a real building project. The result shows that this
   approach relates the KPI formula to the data generated in the building
   operation phase and can automatically give the result after defining the
   space and time of interest, thus supporting building performance
   benchmarking with massive data sets at different levels of details. This
   research proposes a novel approach to integrating the KPI formula and
   linked building data from a semantic perspective, and other researchers
   can use this approach as a foundation for linking data from different
   sources and computational methods such as formula created for building
   performance evaluation. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

   Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Lack of such
   a comprehensive decision-making framework which utilizes BIM, Management
   Information Systems (MIS), simulation, and automation tools to choose
   between different construction alternatives have been addressed in the
   research background. As an example of decision-making objective,
   optimized smart building's equipment combination for a certain project
   should be selected in the feasibility study phase. In this research, a
   comprehensive decision-making framework was developed to choose smart
   building's equipment based on energy consumption and cost trade-off.
   Subsequently, smart building alternatives were considered as a
   decision-making example to choose the best alternative using BIM, MIS
   and simulation tools. The research contributes to the automating of some
   parts of the decision-making framework by developing an Application
   Programming Interface (API). This API helps with making the appropriate
   automating permutation out of possible options, totalizing the cost of
   each combination and sorting data in the research database developed for
   the recommended framework. This framework, database and API can be used
   similarly for any other decision making objective. Finally, a model
   representing the average conditions of residential buildings in Tehran
   was developed to choose the optimized smart building's equipment
   combination of 31 considered options. This optimized combination which
   included all possible smart building options except for smart lighting
   has an investment return of about 7.5 years which is more than that of
   similar projects in other countries due to Iran's low energy carrier
   tariff.},

Title = {Optimization testing for the modeling and characterization of
   three-dimensional elements to enhance interoperability from building
   information modeling (BIM) to building energy modeling (BEM)},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {317},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The principal aim of the different authors regarding the issues
   concerning the interoperability between Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) and Building Energy Modelling (BEM) platforms is focused on
   workflow automation. This article aims to focus on the modeling
   practices, by suggesting practical modeling recommendations for BIM
   modelers, which improve the exportation results to BEM platforms. The
   project followed a two-phase methodology consisting first of the
   proposal of a line of modeling recommendations based on a literature
   review, and second of the application of the recommendations, using an
   experimental model. At the outset, the authors recompiled research
   papers, software tutorials, and the main author's usage (by tool
   testing). The recommendations were organized by categories and fields of
   implementation. For the second phase, a single-family housing project
   was assigned for the testing procedures. The project was modeled with
   the two main BIM platforms available for the research (Autodesk Revit
   and Graphisoft Archicad). The testing procedures included the
   implementation of the recommendations by categories, and each category
   was evaluated by two premises: the geometrical consistency of the
   exported model with the project (by using the Aragog gbXML viewer tool),
   and the utility of the imported model on a BEM platform (by using Design
   Builder software with EnergyPlus). The results of each tested model were
   contrasted and analyzed, to determine if the implemented recommendations
   were successful for improving the exportation process. In conclusion, it
   was found that the recommendations improved the geometrical consistency
   and the elements characterization with the building systems, and an
   energy analytic simulation was successfully fulfilled with the optimized
   model imported from both BIM software. Although the recommendations made
   small improvements from the base to the optimized model, the result for
   each exported model was a successful energy analytic simulation.},

Title = {New Method for Fine Calculation of Bridge Temperature Field Based on BIM
   Solar Radiation Analysis},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2023},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {Fine calculation of bridge temperature fields is significant for
   accurately evaluating thermal actions in bridge structures. Determining
   thermal loads on bridge surfaces caused by solar radiation is the most
   challenging part of the numerical thermal analysis because the sunlit
   and shaded areas on bridge surfaces change continuously with the sun's
   rotation. Existing methods have low accuracy in determining thermal
   loads and cannot be applied to complex bridges. This study presents a
   new method for calculating temperature fields based on the advantages of
   building information modeling (BIM) technology in solar radiation
   analysis (SRA) and information sharing. This method starts with
   obtaining an accurate hourly insolation distribution on bridge surfaces
   through SRA implemented in a BIM system. Then, a Python script
   seamlessly maps the insolation information to finite element surfaces as
   thermal loads. This paper details the new method's implementation steps
   and technical details, and a practical application on a concrete box
   girder demonstrates its applicability and effectiveness. Compared with
   previous methods, the proposed method has significant advantages, such
   as a more accurate calculation for solar radiation, a lower technical
   threshold, a higher degree of automation, less computational time, and
   easier finite element modeling.},

Title = {Implementation of BIM Virtual Models in Industry for the Graphical
   Coordination of Engineering and Architecture Projects},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has traditionally been considered as
   a tool for the graphical representation of architectural and engineering
   projects. This technology has become a key instrument for the
   development of virtual models that simulate the constructive process and
   facilitate the analysis of the designed solutions to detect incidents
   linked to traditional bi-dimensional projects. This article focuses on
   the use of this technology to optimize the design of MEP (mechanical,
   electrical, plumbing) facilities and architecture by developing virtual
   BIM models. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze two
   experiences of complex buildings that have developed a BIM Execution
   Plan to improve the coordination of all disciplines involved, in order
   to explore how these real experiences can contribute to the
   implementation of the use of this technology in the construction
   industry. The results of the research are divided into two aspects: on
   the one hand, the improvements that BIM brings to the coordination and
   optimization of MEP facilities, linked to the typification of design
   incidents detected to anticipate conflicts between disciplines,
   facilitate collaborative design between different agents, keep graphic
   documentation updated and avoid execution problems and additional costs;
   and on the other hand, the keys to facilitating the extension of the use
   of this technology in the industry. Therefore, the conclusions of the
   research point out to the need for improvement in the automation of
   incident detection and the reduction in design process deadlines, as
   well as the need to simplify the virtual modeling process to bring it
   closer to unqualified personnel involved in the workflow and facilitate
   the implementation of this technology in the construction industry.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology of integrating Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) to evaluate the
   economic implications of designing aging-in-place (AIP) homes at the

   growing demand for housing tailored to elderly needs. This study
   emphasizes the importance of early design phases, offering a
   semi-automated model to estimate life cycle costs from design to
   disposal. The model enables comprehensive economic assessments,
   highlighting the long-term feasibility of design decisions by
   considering life cycle costs early in the process. Investing in
   accessible and universal design features upfront can lead to long-term
   savings by reducing the need for extensive future retrofits. The model
   allows for comparisons among different design alternatives, assessing
   the financial impact of features such as wider doorways, accessible
   bathrooms, and elevators. This study provides valuable insights for
   designers and homeowners, supporting efficient decision-making during

Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient and simplified procedure for the 3D
   modelling of buildings, based on the semi-automatic processing of point
   clouds acquired with mobile LiDAR scanners. The procedure is designed
   with the aim at generating BIM, in gbXML format, from the point clouds.
   In this way, the main application of the procedure is the performance of
   energy analysis, towards the increase of the energy efficiency in the
   construction sector, and its consequent contribution to the mitigation
   of the climate change. Thus, the main contribution of the methodology
   proposed is its easiness of use and its level of automation, which allow
   its utilization by users who are experts in the use of energy in
   buildings but non-experts on 3D modelling. The software provides a
   solution for the 3D modelling of complex point clouds of various
   millions of points in times of execution less than 10 minutes. The
   system is evaluated through its application to three different
   real-world scenarios and compared with manual modelling. Moreover, the
   results are used for an example of an energy application, proving their
   performance against manually elaborated models.},

Abstract = {In this work, we present a novel distributed software platform for
   patients with neurodegenerative diseases that affect motor neurons. The
   linking point between this wide range of diseases is the strong social
   impact they have, degrading the freedom of action of the patient; the
   loss of functionality of motor neurons, caused by progressive
   degradation, makes the body unable to move. Thus, our solution aims at
   making patients more autonomous in their daily activities and at
   improving remote health-care monitoring for medical staff by combining
   virtual reality, building information modeling (BIM), the Internet of
   Things (IoT), and eye-tracking technologies. Starting from the 3-D
   parametric BIM model, patients can virtually explore the surrounding
   environment (through eye movements) and control the environment by
   interacting with IoT smart devices, thus performing different tasks.},

Title = {Designers' perspective on the use of automation to support regulatory

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Automation has been long explored to improve regulatory compliance
   during building design. Despite substantial research efforts on
   developing means to enable this process, there has been limited success
   in practical implementations. Designers' inputs are often undervalued in
   such developments, leading to solutions that are not effectively
   incorporated into the design process. This issue is even more difficult
   in healthcare projects due to their complexity and convoluted regulatory
   frameworks. In this paper, we describe how designers perceive the use of
   automation to support regulatory compliance in healthcare projects,
   through the analysis of a series of semi-structured interviews. We found
   that regulatory documents have a large influence on design and their
   compliance often consists of an unformalised process in practice.
   Furthermore, we identified that subjectivity is perceived in
   requirements as needed due to the creativity involved in design, whereas
   automation can be understood as liberating in this context depending on
   how it is used. Improvement needs focussing on the revision of the
   regulatory framework as well as on software development have been
   highlighted by participants during the interviews, which led to the
   proposition of recommendations to help achieve their benefits in
   practice.},

   Malaysian Construction Industry Case},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Safety on construction sites is now a top priority for the construction
   industry all around the world. Construction labor is often seen as
   hazardous, putting employees at risk of serious accidents and diseases.
   The use of Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0 advanced technologies such as
   robotics and automation, building information modelling (BIM), augmented
   reality and virtualization, and wireless monitoring and sensors are seen
   to be an effective way to improve the health and safety of construction
   workers at the job site, as well as to ensure construction safety
   management in general. The main aim of this research was to analyze the
   IR-4.0-related technologies for improving the health and safety problems
   in the construction industry of Malaysia by utilizing the analytical
   hierarchy process (AHP) technique. IR-4.0-related technologies show
   great potential in addressing the construction industry's existing
   health and safety problems from the perspective of civil engineering
   practitioners and industry experts. This research adopted the analytical
   hierarchy process (AHP) for quantitative analysis of data collected
   through the survey questionnaire approach. The findings of the study
   indicate that from matrix multiplication, the highest importance among
   the criteria and the alternatives was for BIM with a score of 0.3855,
   followed by wireless monitoring and sensors (0.3509). This research
   suggests that building information modelling (BIM) and integrated
   systems had the greatest potential as advanced technology and should be
   prioritized when it comes to introducing it to the construction industry
   to improve the current health and safety performances.},

   and a real use case analysis, followed by formalization of preprocessing
   methods, their verification via two pilot building models, and
   evaluation by practitioners through panel discussion. The developed
   procedures can automatically assign loads, supports and joints
   floor-wise and reduce the model preparation time, errors and design
   costs in daily structural analysis practice; however, further adoption

Title = {Semantic interpretation of architectural and archaeological geometries:
   Point cloud segmentation for HBIM parameterisation},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {130},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The creation of Cultural Heritage (CH) Digital Twins is based on i) the
   capture of geometric data using digital technologies (laser scanning and
   photogrammetry); ii) the processing of the raw data to identify, segment
   and label the objects; and iii) their conversion into BIM objects.
   Hitherto, the most extensive method for BIM seg-mentation and modelling
   is manual, which led to research into the automation of this process,
   also in the field of CH. Manual operations are still labour-intensive
   and mathematical approaches are not inclusive for all CH specialists. In
   this context, this research studies the application of Brodu and Lague's
   morphological segmen-tation algorithm called CANUPO to classify the
   architectural components of the facade of the 16th-century Casa de
   Pilatos Palace in Seville, Spain, from a Terrestrial Laser Scanning
   (TLS) point cloud dataset. In this paper, the experimentation on
   semantic segmentation was carried out using open-source software,
   specifically the CANUPO algorithm integrated into CloudCompare software.},

   automatic building information model semantic enrichment - Exploring
   node features enhancing strategies},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {147},

Abstract = {The integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Building
   Information Modeling (BIM) unveils trans- formative potential for the
   semantic enrichment of BIM data, offering significant advancements to
   the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. This
   paper addresses the critical issue of spatial recognition and
   classification in BIM through the proposed node-enhanced,
   self-supervised graph neural network model, Node-Enhanced Graph-
   Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (NE-Graph- BERT),
   which incorporates edge features. This model represents each space as a
   node, utilizing spatial relational edges as inputs and is trained on an
   independently developed knowledge base consisting of 14 space types and
   4 relational features across three major categories of architectural
   space layouts, enabling automatic identification of spatial features.
   Experimental results indicate that: (1) the enhanced GNNs with
   integrated edge features achieves precise spatial classification of
   building functions on extensive building diagrams; (2) NE-Graph-BERT
   surpasses existing GNNs models in both Precision (97.08\%) and F1-score
   (96.75\%); (3) spatial classification accuracy and interoperability are
   notably enhanced, reaching up to 97.05\%. This study advances the
   application of GNNs for semantic enrichment in BIM and offers practical
   insights for their implementation in real AEC projects, paving the way
   for enhanced efficiency and automation in applications including
   compliance review, spatial analysis, and building evacuation.},

Title = {Parametric design of an automated kinetic building facade using BIM: A
   case study perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {73},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Pollination plays a critical role in maintaining human life and its
   importance has been widely recognized by researchers. However, as the
   world population grows, construction activities have increased, leading
   to an expanded carbon footprint that has adverse effects on the
   environment. This has resulted in the loss of natural habitats for
   pollinators. To address these issues, this research aimed to design an
   innovative mixed-use building to promote biodiversity conservation. The
   building was designed to have global visibility and to combine various
   elements in different locations to achieve maximum functionality.
   Automated features were incorporated into the building's structure to
   enhance its efficiency. Throughout the project, experts were consulted
   to ensure the building met sustainability standards and the best site
   was selected. BIM was used as part of the research methodology to design
   the building and calculate its sustainability and energy-efficient
   elements. As a result, the building achieved Gold certification status
   and has made a significant contribution to green building and
   sustainability in the built environment. The final product not only
   addressed the biodiversity issue, by designing a building where
   honeybees and humans coexisted but also provided a new solution for
   future developments in sustainable design. To ensure that these efforts
   are successful, it is important for different sectors, including
   Architectural, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO), to work
   together to create a more sustainable future for the planet.},

Abstract = {Purpose Modular construction is widely adopted and used in the
   construction industry to improve construction performance with respect
   to both efficiency and productivity. The evaluation of design options
   for modular construction can be iterative, and thus automation is
   required to develop design alternatives. This research aims to explore
   the potential of utilizing the generative design approach to automate
   modular construction for residential building structures in urban areas
   such as New York City. Design/methodology/approach The proposed research
   methodology is investigated for a systematic approach to parametrize
   design parameters for modular construction layout design as well as
   incorporate design rules/parameters into modularizing design layouts in
   a Building Information Modeling (BIM) environment. Based on current
   building codes and necessary inputs by the user, the proposed approach
   enables providing recommendations in a generative design method and
   optimizes construction processes by performing analytical calculations.
   Findings The generative design has been found to be efficient in
   generating layout designs for modular construction based on parametric
   design. The integration of BIM and generative design can allow industry
   practitioners to fast generate design layout with evaluations from
   constructability perspectives. Originality/value This paper has proposed
   a new approach of incorporating generative design with BIM technologies
   to solve module layout generations by considering design and
   constructability constraints. The method can be further extended for
   evaluating modular construction design from manufacturability and
   assembly perspectives.},

Title = {ADAPTING THE 3S-MODEL FOR INVESTIGATING TRUST IN ARC SOLUTIONS IN THE
   DANISH CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {991-1009},
Abstract = {Automated solutions to building compliance checking has been slow in its
   implementation in the Danish construction industry. Mainly
   socio-technical barriers, such as trust in automation challenge the
   spread of technological advances from research and development. This
   paper studies the trust relationship ofArchitectural, Engineering, and
   Construction (AEC) professionals towards Automated Rule Checking (ARC)
   systems in Denmark. The 3S-model from the field of cognitive psychology
   was employed to help understanding the varying ways people assess
   information credibility. Three hypotheses were tested through
   experimentation to investigate the significance of different information
   features, and pertaining user characteristics on human-automation trust
   behaviors in the domain of ARC. Although the highly specified research
   area targeted a relatively small demographic within the Danish
   construction industry, the findings present an interesting new
   perspective on the common characteristics and trust behaviors of the end
   user. With the refinement of the framework's application, the 3S-model
   can elucidate the many factors that are believed to influence technology
   acceptance within the industry. This research aims to contribute to the
   development of ARC solutions with a front-end viewpoint on
   trustworthiness.},

   Information Modeling-Systematic Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Predictive maintenance of built assets often relies on scheduled routine
   practices that are disconnected from real-time stress assessment,
   degradation and defects. However, while Digital Twin (DT) technology
   within building and urban studies is maturing rapidly, its use in
   predictive maintenance is limited. Traditional preventive and reactive
   maintenance strategies that are more prevalent in facility management
   are not intuitive, not resource efficient, cannot prevent failure and
   either underserve the asset or are surplus to requirements. City
   Information Modeling (CIM) refers to a federation of BIM models in
   accordance with real-world geospatial references, and it can be deployed
   as an Urban Digital Twin (UDT) at city level, like BIM's deployment at
   building level. This study presents a systematic review of 105
   Scopus-indexed papers to establish current trends, gaps and
   opportunities for a cognitive predictive maintenance framework in the
   architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry.
   A UDT framework consisting of the CIM of a section of the University of
   Florida campus is proposed to bridge the knowledge gap highlighted in
   the systematic review. The framework illustrates the potential for
   CNN-IoT integration to improve predictive maintenance through advance
   notifications. It also eliminates the use of centralized information
   archiving.},

Title = {A Simplified Method of Cartographic Visualisation of Buildings'
   Interiors (2D+) for Navigation Applications},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article proposes an original method of a coherent and simplified
   cartographic presentation of the interior of buildings called 2D+, which
   can be used in geoinformation applications that do not support an
   extensive three-dimensional visualisation or do not have access to a 3D
   model of the building. A simplified way of cartographic visualisation
   can be used primarily in indoor navigation systems and other
   location-based services (LBS) applications. It can also be useful in
   systems supporting facility management (FM) and various kinds of
   geographic information systems (GIS). On the one hand, it may increase
   an application's efficiency; on the other, it may unify the method of
   visualisation in the absence of a building's 3D model. Thanks to the
   proposed method, it is possible to achieve the same effect regardless of
   the data source used: Building Information Modelling (BIM), a
   Computer-aided Design (CAD) model, or traditional architectural and
   construction drawings. Such a solution may be part of a broader concept
   of a multi-scale presentation of buildings' interiors. The article
   discusses the issues of visualising data and converting data to the
   appropriate coordinate system, as well as the properties of the
   application model of data.},

Title = {Perceived Benefits of Automation and Artificial Intelligence in the AEC
   Sector: An Interpretive Structural Modeling Approach},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Increasing demand for infrastructure amidst the surge in the
   urbanization of cities and newly emerging commercial nerves has spurred
   the need to reinvent and rethink traditional approaches for delivering
   infrastructure. This has been identified as even more critical given the
   global drive and discourse on the sustainability of the construction
   sector and its health and safety performance. Given the potential gains
   of adopting construction automation and AI in infrastructure delivery,
   stakeholders' convincing appreciation of its benefit is vital to its
   widespread adoption in the AEC sector. This explored and evaluated the
   critical benefits of integrating automation in construction processes in
   the architectural, engineering, and construction sector and the use of
   artificial intelligence (AI) in driving its systems and workflows. The
   study adopts an interpretive structural modeling approach based on
   interviews of construction stakeholders in diverse countries to develop
   a hierarchical model of the interrelationships of the benefits.
   Furthermore, the Matrice d'Impacts croises-multiplication applique a
   classement analysis (MICMAC) was used to categorize the benefits.
   Highlighted perceived benefits such as improved project quality,
   simplification of construction tasks, workflow improvements, and safety
   performance, amongst others, were fractionalized into levels. The
   study's findings are critical in satisfying a cost-benefit index of
   adopting automation and AI in the AEC sector. The results provide
   recommendations on effective approaches pivotal to driving automation
   and AI for practice and research. This is of further importance to
   construction stakeholders, policymakers, and local authorities in
   building strategies and roadmaps for proper integration of these systems
   and widespread adoption.},

Abstract = {With the outset of Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0), every sector is
   escalating to get enrichment out of it, whether they are research- or
   industry-oriented. The Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC)
   industry lags a bit in adopting it because of its multi-faceted
   dependencies and unique nature of work. Despite this, a trend has been
   seen recently to hone the IR 4.0 multitudes in the AEC industry. The
   upsurge has been seen in the usage of Immersive Technologies (ImTs) as
   one of the disruptive techniques. This paper studies the literature
   based on ImTs, which are Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR),
   and Mixed Reality (MR) integrating with Building Information Modelling
   (BIM) in the AEC sector. A total number of 444 articles were selected
   from Scopus following the preferred reporting items for systematic
   reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol of reviewing the literature.
   Among the selected database, 64 papers are identified as the result of
   following the protocol, and the articles are divided into eight domains
   relevant to the AEC industry, namely client/stakeholder, design
   exploration, design analysis, construction planning, construction
   monitoring, construction health/safety, facility/management, and
   education/training. This study adopts both a scientometric analysis for
   bibliometrics visualization and a critical review using Strength
   Weakness Opportunity Threat (SWOT) analysis for finding gaps and state
   of play. The novelty of this paper lies in the analysis techniques used
   in the literature to provide an insight into the literature, and it
   provides directions for the future with an emphasis on developing
   sustainable development goals (SDGs). In addition, research directions
   for the future growth on the adoption of ImTs are identified and
   presented based on categorization in immersive devices,
   graphical/non-graphical data and, responsive/integrative processes. In
   addition, five subcategories for each direction are listed, citing the
   limitations and future/needs. This study presents the roadmap for the
   successful adoption of ImTs for industry practitioners and stakeholders
   in the AEC industry for various domains. The paper shows that there are
   studies on ImTs with or without BIM; however, future studies should
   focus on the usage of ImTs in various sectors such as modular integrated
   construction (MiC) or emerging needs such as SDGs.},

Title = {Seismic-Energy Retrofit as Information-Value: Axiological Programming
   for the Ecological Transition},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The research deals with the issue of the seismic and energy retrofit of
   historic building fabrics having as reference a historic district of
   Syracuse (Italy). The prospect of the ecological transition on the one
   hand and the public support funding on the other claim for a valuation
   programming approach implying the creation of multiple scenarios, each
   of which is inspired by a different and complementary degree of
   ``saliency and urgency{''}. These two dimensions of ``being worth{''} by
   a building aggregation having an its own shape and belonging to a larger
   and more complex urban system need to be addressed according to some
   axiological reference, in this case, the concerns of the efficiency and
   fairness of public spending. This experience concerns the creation of a
   value-based programming pattern of the seismic-energy retrofit process
   framed in a Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment aimed at
   identifying the best intervention strategy among the several ones that
   can be generated in the logic of the parametric design. Both seismic and
   energy retrofit expected performances, in fact, can be scaled,
   complementing the extension and intensity of the interventions. This
   experiment takes advantage of the BIM multidimensional logic in line
   with the multiple scales and purposes implied by the relationships
   between individual/communal axiological profiles and present/future
   prospects. The experiment consists of the creation of an additive
   cost-oriented design platform based on which the different and
   progressive combinations of intensity and extension of the interventions
   can be compared and selected.},

Title = {Scenarios for Integrating IPS-IMU System with BIM Technology in
   Construction Safety Control},
Journal = {PRACTICE PERIODICAL ON STRUCTURAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Occupational health and safety are the highest priorities in the
   construction industry. A significant amount of effort has been expended
   to address and improve site safety. Nevertheless, the rate of injuries
   and fatalities in construction is high compared to other industries,
   with falling from heights, falling objects, and tripping hazards the
   leading causes of fatal and injury accidents in construction. Multiple
   modern technologies have been implemented on construction sites to
   monitor worker safety exposures and performance. However, to date,
   worker locations cannot be accurately identified remotely, especially
   for those laborers who work on high-rise building projects. Building
   information modeling (BIM) contains rich building and site information,
   such as dimensions and elevations, and an indoor positioning system
   (IPS) inertial measurement unit (IMU) provides a worker's conditions,
   including their position, walking speed, and facing direction.
   Integrating an IPS-IMU system with BIM has great potential for overall
   construction management and safety control of workers. This paper aims
   to provide feasible and practical scenarios to use a proposed integrated
   autowarning system for site safety control. Using data collected from an
   IPS-IMU and from a three-dimensional site model, the developed system
   could provide adequate safety notifications and real-time warnings based
   on safety regulations, guidelines, and policies to prevent site
   accidents from occurring in an effective and proactive manner. The
   research also provides an additional approach for further research on
   innovation and automation development in the construction industry. (C)

Title = {Automated monitoring innovations for efficient and safe construction
   practices},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As construction projects increase in complexity, there are growing
   challenges with conventional monitoring methods in terms of efficiency,
   safety, and competitiveness. Traditional supervision techniques are
   labourintensive, intermittent, and prone to errors. Hence, this study
   statistically evaluates the potential advantages of photogrammetry,
   sensors, and algorithms to enable continuous automated monitoring. The
   results of this survey were analysed to compare manual and automated
   monitoring systems. The outcome shows that the Malaysian construction
   industry is aware of Automated Monitoring Innovations for Efficient and
   Safe Construction Practices. The top ranked factor was Photogrammetry
   which had a relative importance index (RII) of 0.821 for straightforward
   site monitoring and 0.812 for accelerated 3D BIM modelling. The RII for
   sensors to track labourers, apparatus, and progress in real time was
   0.82, while the RII for hazard anticipation was 0.796. Automation
   achieved a reduction in fatigue by 0.784, labour intensity by 0.792, and
   time demands by 0.768, as measured by the RII. A conceptual framework
   was developed that incorporates measurable improvements in schedules,
   safety, and quality control. Automated solutions, as opposed to human
   examinations which are prone to error, provided exhaustive geographical
   data and ongoing surveillance notwithstanding obstacles pertaining to
   cost, cybersecurity, privacy, and integration. Construction monitoring
   must incorporate new technology, strategic change management, data
   investments, and supporting regulations to increase profitability,
   safety, and efficiency as competition and complexity increase.},

Title = {Project-Based Introduction to Computing in Construction Management
   Curriculum: A Case Study},

Abstract = {Computing technology is reshaping the way in which professionals in the
   architecture, engineering, and construction industries conduct their
   business. The execution of construction tasks is changing from
   traditional 2D to 3D building information modeling (BIM)-based concepts.
   The use of BIM is expanded and enriched by the introduction of advanced
   computing technologies. At the same time, the demands for graduates in
   construction management with basic computing technology skills are on
   the rise. One of the challenges of construction management (CM) programs
   is how to incorporate computing knowledge so that future graduates can
   gain more experience with it during their undergraduate education. This
   paper presents a case study on this topic from an undergraduate
   construction management course at Purdue University. The in-class
   exercises and project required the use of computing technologies (e.g.,
   quantity takeoff software, scheduling software, and Python programming)
   in this case study. The performance of students was evaluated before and
   after the project and the exercises. The findings showed the benefits of
   incorporating computing into a construction management curriculum as
   follows: (1) introducing the students to the efficiency and accuracy of
   computing technologies in CM; and (2) improving students' knowledge and
   skills in computing technologies and professional software applications.
   Based on students' feedback, short-term (one-class-long) programming
   training during the semester and more detailed instructions for a
   project are needed improvements in this course. The practice in this
   study provides insights for other instructors seeking to include more
   computing technologies into CM courses.},

Abstract = {The choice of pipe materials is a necessary process in construction,
   influenced by numerous complex considerations. Alternative materials
   require careful study due to their differences in properties,
   performance, and cost according to the specific functions of elements.
   The Value Engineering (VE) process requires time for implementation due
   to the need for collaborative effort and multiple workshops. This study
   proposes a framework for automating the VE process for choosing
   alternative pipe materials. The framework is based on accepted standard
   tests, expert inputs, and selected agreed-upon criteria for material
   pipe measurements. The framework methodology combines the Analytic
   Hierarchy Process (AHP)/Pairwise Comparison and Function Analysis System
   Technique (FAST). The study methodology includes ranking criteria
   weights, incorporating pipe functions, and using Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) automation software. Finally, the framework's
   application is demonstrated using a case study of a potable water
   network project in Saudi Arabia. The case study has three pipe material
   alternatives - ductile iron (DI), polyethylene (PE), and
   glass-reinforced plastic (GRP). This study supports stakeholders in
   making a decision and choosing the best alternative based on quality,
   function, and cost together.},

Title = {Building Information Modelling- (BIM-) Based Generative Design for
   Drywall Installation Planning in Prefabricated Construction},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {In prefabricated construction, building components are manufactured
   off-site before shipping to the site for installation. Accurate design
   and planning are essential for smooth on-site execution and improved
   efficiency, which requires evaluations of various design options.
   However, due to the design process's complexity, such evaluations cannot
   be achieved without automation and optimization. Meanwhile, the recent
   advancement of digital design technologies (e.g., building information
   modelling (BIM)) has enabled flexibility in the design process. The
   integration of BIM with other analytical algorithms also allows
   optimization of designs, such as the generative design that can
   parametrize the design. This study proposes a generative design approach
   that utilizes the optimization of the drywall installation layout to
   improve overall project efficiency. The framework includes a decision
   support module that considers environmental, cost, and aesthetic aspects
   to identify the optimal layout. The framework's practical applicability
   has been successfully demonstrated through a case study. After
   implementation, three ``best{''} design alternatives were found
   according to the decision aspects. The design improvements achieved were
   37.5\%, 7\%, and 54\% for the environmental, cost, and aesthetic
   factors, respectively. Accordingly, practitioners can make better
   decisions on planning drywall projects. This approach has proven
   effective in planning drywall installation and can be applied in similar
   design scenarios for other prefabricated construction processes.},

Title = {Digital Twins in Structural Health Assessment and Monitoring:
   Applications in Historical Timber Buildings},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 11},
Abstract = {This paper explores the application of Digital Twins (DTs) for
   supporting the structural health monitoring (SHM) of timber buildings,
   with a particular emphasis on historical timber structures. It reviews
   technologies and methods for DT creation, examining how geospatial data
   and Building Information Modeling (BIM) serves as foundational elements
   in developing digital twins. The paper discusses integrating these
   elements with various data and models to enhance SHM tasks, detailing
   actionable DT approaches for documenting, analyzing, simulating and
   predicting structural behavior. The study highlights that while
   high-fidelity geometric models are well developed, their application for
   advanced SHM tasks remains limited. Integration of sensor data into BIM
   frameworks is promising but still faces challenges such as limited
   automation and difficulties in handling real-time and long-term data.
   Additionally, the paper notes that the implementation of DTs for the
   simulation of the effects of hygrothermal phenomena on the long-term
   behavior and durability of timber structures is underexplored.
   Multi-dimensional BIM models and machine and deep learning techniques in
   data-driven, physics-based models are promising approaches for timber
   cultural heritage management and beyond.},

   HOMES AT THE CONCEPTUAL STAGE},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {While the Canadian population ages, designers are encountering new
   challenges that significantly affect the design of new houses. This
   demographic shift will impose major changes in the demand for housing
   toward more adaptable and specialized homes that require designers to
   develop new strategic design solutions. Presently, the main challenge to
   designers when creating age-in-place houses is lacking the knowledge
   about the requirements of that type of homes. Therefore, this study
   describes the development of a Semi-automated computer model that offers
   designers and users a unique opportunity to do real-time simulation in
   an interactive environment while enhancing the communication and
   interaction between owners and designers to meet inhabitants' needs by
   reducing future modifications and alterations of houses to age in them.
   The said model is a cloud-based integration between BIM, Universal
   Design (UD), Age-in-Place (AIP) design requirements, and Virtual Reality
   (VR) that allows owners to be engaged in the design process at the early
   stage to achieve efficient outcomes.},

Abstract = {The construction industry is characterized by the diversity of its
   processes, whereby persons involved in changing project communities are
   confronted with a changing interplay of software applications.
   Therefore, planning workflows, and especially the exchange of
   information between stakeholders, need to be formalized. The automation
   and execution of these workflows go one step further to achieve added
   value in implementation and project management using building
   information modeling. For the configuration and execution of
   collaborative BIM workflows with compatible software products, a
   framework is conceived and developed that enables the modeling of
   project-specific workflows by linking individual software tools based on
   a standardized process notation. The resulting toolchains enable
   seamless information exchange between applications that integrate an
   openCDE-compliant web interface. The methodological approach in this
   paper is a concept implementation, including a proof of concept. For the
   concept development, a review of the state of the art is conducted, and
   requirements are analyzed. The concept development comprises data models
   and API descriptions and includes the concept of a central integration
   platform. The interaction between workflow management on the platform
   and the execution of tasks in the software product clients is explained.
   The implementation of the toolchains on the proposed platform is
   evaluated in a demonstrator scenario.},

Abstract = {Purpose-Green building (GB) maintenance is increasingly accepted in the
   construction industry, so it can now be interpreted as an industry best
   practice for maintenance planning. However, the performance competency
   and design knowledge of the practice's building control instrument
   process can be affected by its evaluation and the information management
   of building information modelling (BIM)-based model checking (BMC).
   These maintenance-planning problems have not yet been investigated in
   instances such as the Grenfell Tower fire (14 June 2017, approximately
   80 fatalities) in North Kensington, West
   London.Design/methodology/approach- This study proposes a theoretical
   framework for analysing the existing conceptualisation of BIM tools and
   techniques based on a critical review of GB maintenance environments.
   These are currently employed on GB maintenance ecosystems embedded in
   project teams that can affect BMC practices in the automation system
   process. In order to better understand how BMC is implemented in GB
   ecosystem projects, a quantitative case study is conducted in the
   Malaysian public works department (Jabatan Kerja Raya (JKR)).Findings-
   GB ecosystem projects were not as effective as planned due to safety
   awareness, design planning, inadequate track insulation, environmental
   (in) compatibility and inadequate building access management.
   Descriptive statistics and an ANOVA were applied to analyse the data.
   The study is reinforced by a process flow, which is transformed into a
   theoretical framework.Originality/value- Industry practitioners can use
   the developed framework to diagnose BMC application issues and leverage
   the staff competency inherent in an ecosystem to plan GB maintenance
   environments successfully.},

Title = {A BIM-BASED TECHNO-ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK AND TOOL FOR EVALUATING AND
   COMPARING BUILDING RENOVATION STRATEGIES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {246-265},
Abstract = {Building renovation presents real challenges for project participants
   which frequently generate high cost and schedule overruns. The
   disruption caused to occupants is one of the main challenges for the
   planning and management of renovation works. To better manage occupant
   interference and enable the acceleration of renovation works, this study
   aims to develop a novel framework for the assessment and optimisation of
   renovation strategies using BIM. The concept of disruption is formalised
   through a renovation ontology using the UML language. To enable process
   automation, the renovation ontology is then populated, and knowledge
   related to renovation tasks, constraints, duration, cost, equipment, and
   disruption are captured, structured and validated with industry
   partners. A digital tool and a set of Key Performance Indicators are
   also developed so as to facilitate the identification, assessment and
   optimisation of renovation scenarios in terms of cost, project duration
   and disruptive potential. Using a step-by-step process, detailed
   descriptions of the methodologies and workflows of the proposed
   framework are finally provided and demonstrated on a live case study
   located in Greece.The findings show no spatial correlation exist for the
   disruption concept and also confirm the disruptive nature of building
   floor renovation which can lead to a low rate of retrofitting them.
   Furthermore, the findings question the general applicability of the
   Whiteman et al.'s heuristic suggesting to prioritise the planning and
   execution of the most disruptive renovation activities as early as
   possible in the renovation process, and of the preference of Fawcett for
   a one-off renovation strategy recommending to conduct renovation works
   in one go as quickly as possible. Ultimately, the TEA framework will be
   further demonstrated and tested by end-users on three additional
   European case studies within the RINNO project which will particularly
   help validating the added value and benefits of the TEA framework from a
   user perspective.},

Title = {An approach based on the ifcOWL ontology to support indoor navigation},
Journal = {EGYPTIAN INFORMATICS JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper presents an indoor navigation support system based on the
   Building Information Models (BIM) paradigm. Although BIM is initially
   defined for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction/Facility
   Management (AEC/FM) industry, the authors believe that it can provide
   added value in this context. To this end, the authors will focus on the
   Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard for the formal representation
   of BIM. The approach followed in this paper will be based on the ifcOWL
   ontology, which translates the IFC schemas into Ontology Web Language
   (OWL). Several modifications of this ontology have been proposed,
   consisting of the inclusion of new items, SWRL rules and SQWRL searches.
   This way of expressing the elements of a building can be used to code
   information that is very useful for navigation, such as the location of
   elements related to the actions desired by the user. It is important to
   note that this design is intended to be used as a complement to other
   well-known tools and techniques for indoor navigation. The proposed
   modifications have been successfully tested in a variety of simulated
   and real scenarios. The main limitation of the proposal is the immense
   amount of information contained in the ifcOWL ontology, which causes
   difficulties involving its processing and the time necessary to perform
   operations on it. Those elements that are considered important have been
   selected, removing those that seem secondary to navigation. This
   procedure will result in a significant reduction in the storage and
   semantic processing of the information. Thus, for a system with 1000
   individuals (in the ontological sense), the processing time is about 90
   s. The authors regard this time as acceptable, since in most cases the
   tasks involved can be considered part of the system initialization,
   meaning they will only be executed once at the beginning of the process.

Title = {From BIM to Digital Twin: A transformation process through advanced
   control modeling and automated commissioning using daylight and
   artificial lighting as examples},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {329},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {An essential part of commissioning is verifying that the implemented
   systems are operating in accordance with the functional specifications.
   Commissioning also represents the handover between design and operation
   and is therefore an interface between different stakeholders. Building
   Information Modeling (BIM), as a platform for collaboration and
   information sharing, offers potential for both pre-commissioning, by
   providing evaluation options prior to implementation, and for automated
   commissioning of building control systems, by reducing on-site effort
   and the risk of error. However, current BIM approaches largely neglect
   this step due to a lack of modeling support. BIM is often seen as a key
   technology for digital twins. This transformation process can take place
   through the modeling of building control systems, which represent the
   interface between operation and design and can capture all relevant
   operating parameters. By integrating the model with data from simulation
   during early design and during the life of a building, a digital
   twin-based assessment of a building's energy performance throughout its
   life-cycle becomes possible. To realize these benefits, model-based
   engineering for model-based building commissioning is used to develop a
   digital twin that improves building operations through data-driven
   simulation. The resulting model-based tool environment encompasses an
   agile and continuous engineering process that is aligned with the
   building life-cycle and addresses current BIM characteristics according
   to the standard. Our evaluation using the Technology Acceptance Model
   confirms that the proposal presented is practical to implement and
   contributes to improving building operations. This is achieved by
   simplifying the pre-configuration, simulation-based evaluation and
   automated commissioning of building control systems for the subsequent
   commissioning of digital twins.},

Title = {Semantic classification and hash code accelerated detection of design
   changes in BIM models},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {115},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As the design process of a building or infrastructure is complex with
   iterative steps and multidisciplinary collaboration, design changes are
   inevitable and efficient change detection based on Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) is essential for design collaboration and quality
   control. Although some detection methods have been proposed to tackle
   the problem, majority of them regard syntactic data changes as design
   changes, which always yield incorrect and meaningless results. For
   instance, exchanging the locations of two identical columns is
   meaningless from the viewpoint of a designer, which the current methods
   take it as a design change. Otherwise, additional time is needed to
   avoid these issues, thus leading to high time consumption. To address
   this problem, we first propose a semantic classification of design
   changes with three categories of data changes and three levels of design
   changes. Then, an efficient detection method considering the proposed
   semantic classification of design changes is proposed with
   hash-code-based acceleration. After implementing the proposed and
   existing methods, the detection performance of our method is compared
   with the performances of existing methods and invited designers based on
   4 groups of BIM models. Results show that our method could: 1) detect
   semantic changes with 100\% correctness while reducing up to 98.1\% of
   the detection time of existing methods, and 2) improve the average
   detection rate of designers from 81.3\% to 100\% while saving 99.88\% of
   the design reviewing time (detecting 7 changes from 5800 instances).
   This research contributes to the body of knowledge a new definition of
   design changes and an approach to efficient design change detection with
   hash-code-based acceleration. Meanwhile, the proposed classification of
   design changes and developed BIM models in this research can also be
   taken as a baseline for developing and validating new detection methods.},

Title = {Calculation of embodied GHG emissions in early building design stages
   using BIM and NLP-based semantic model healing},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {284},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {To reach the goals of limiting global warming, the embodied greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions of new buildings need to be quantified and optimized
   in the very early design stages, during which design decisions
   significantly influence the success of projects in achieving their
   performance goals. Semantically rich building information models (BIM)
   enable to perform an automated quantity take-off of the relevant
   elements for calculating a whole building life cycle assessment (LCA).
   However, imprecise type and property information often found in today's
   BIM practice hinders a seamless processing for downstream applications.
   At the same time, the early design stages are characterized by high
   uncertainty due to the lack of information and knowledge, making a
   holistic and consistent LCA for supporting design decisions and
   optimizing performance challenging. In assessing this often vague
   information, it is essential to consider different levels of element and
   material information for matching BIM to LCA data. For example, the
   structural properties of concrete are not yet defined in early design
   stages and should instead be considered as a range of material options
   due to different compressive strength classes. This paper presents a
   novel methodology for automatically matching the coarse information
   available in BIM models of the early design stages to the respective
   entries in LCA databases as a basis for a fully automated calculation
   process of the embodied GHG emissions of new buildings. This approach
   solves the existing gap in the automation process of manually enriching
   BIM models and adding information of LCA data and missing layers of
   vague models. In more detail, the proposed method is based on Natural
   Language Processing (NLP), using different strategies to increase
   performance in matching elements and materials from a BIM model to a
   knowledge database to enrich environmental indicators of commonly used
   elements' materials. The knowledge database contains all missing
   information for LCAs and has different levels of information for a range
   of several potential design options of elements and materials, including
   their dependencies. Accordingly, this paper investigates multiple NLP
   techniques and evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art deep
   learning models such as GermaNet, SpaCy, or BERT. Following this, the
   most performant NLP approach is used to provide an automatic workflow
   for matching Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) elements to the knowledge
   database, facilitating a seamless LCA in the early stages of design. For
   five different case studies, the performances of the proposed matching
   method are analyzed. Finally, one case study is selected to compare the
   embodied emissions results to those of the conventional process.},

   Components Based on CV},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems are vital in
   construction engineering as their installation quality significantly
   impacts project success. Traditional inspection methods often fail to
   ensure compliance with building information models (BIMs), leading to
   safety hazards due to deviations during construction. Spurred by these
   concerns, this paper introduces a novel BIM-based pipeline construction
   comparison system that relies on computer vision technology. The
   developed system uses deep learning algorithms for real-time data
   collection to enhance monitoring efficiency and accuracy, as well as
   advanced object detection algorithms to compare real-time construction
   images with BIMs. The proposed architecture addresses the limitations of
   existing techniques in handling MEP complexities, and through an
   automatic comparison and verification process, it detects deviations
   promptly, ensuring adherence to design specifications. This study
   innovatively integrates real-time data collection, deep learning
   algorithms, and an automated BIM comparison mechanism to enhance the
   accuracy, efficiency, and automation of pipeline installation
   monitoring, addressing the limitations of existing inspection methods.},

Title = {Unsupervised reconstruction of Building Information Modeling wall

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {120},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Scan-to-BIM of existing buildings is in high demand by the construction
   industry. However, these models are costly and time-consuming to create.
   The automation of this process is still subject of ongoing research.
   Current obstacles include the interpretation and reconstruction of raw
   point cloud data, which is complicated by the complexity of built
   structures, the vast amount of data to be processed and the variety of
   objects in the built environment. This research aims to overcome the
   current obstacles and reconstruct the structure of buildings in an
   unsupervised manner. More specifically, a novel method is presented to
   automatically reconstruct BIM wall objects and their topology. Key
   contributions of the method are the ability to reconstruct different
   wall axis and connection types and the simultaneous processing of entire
   multi-story structures. The method is validated with the Stanford
   2D-3D-Semantics Dataset (2D-3D-S).},

Abstract = {IFC2BCM is a novel software tool designed to generate IndoorGML and
   Building Configuration Models (BCM) from IFC/BIM models. The primary
   motivation behind IFC2BCM is to develop a tool for generating BCM as the
   core foundation of a Spatial Design Support System that will evaluate
   layout designs of complex buildings such as hospitals regarding
   operational efficiency. The software addresses the need for detailed
   spatial network analysis and simulation modelling in complex

   IndoorGML, and subsequently into a comprehensive BCM. The BCM generated
   by this tool consists of geometric, topological, semantic, and
   operational information, it supports applications such as space
   optimization, facility management, ensuring safety, and indoor
   navigation. More generally, the results are relevant to the study of

Title = {Multi-objective optimization for LEED-new construction using BIM and
   genetic algorithms},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Although LEED excels in reducing the negative environmental impacts and
   the energy consumption of buildings, the high costs in the early phases
   of the implementation and pursuit of LEED certification are pushing away
   some project owners from entering the process. How can the objectives of
   (1) getting the points necessary to achieve the desired LEED
   certification and (2) the life-cycle cost of sustainable projects be
   balanced? In this study, Non -dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II
   (NSGA-II), a multi-objective optimization tool, is proposed to find the
   optimal solution measured in terms of life-cycle cost and sustainability
   for a new construction project pursuing LEED v4 BD + C New Construction
   and Major Renovation certification. A BIM project of a 3-floor
   educational building was selected as a case study to verify the
   efficiency and soundness of the proposed model. The results show that
   the method does indeed lead to optimal solutions. The proposed model is
   expected to benefit con-struction owners, designers, and contractors
   alike, Expanding the database of components and extending the model to
   cover LEED v4 projects other than BD + C New Construction and Major
   Renovation could improve the reach and impact of the proposed model.},

Title = {Shaping the future of facility management. Market and literature
   insights on digital twin adoption},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 21},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to investigate the readiness of facility
   management (FM) to digitalize the construction sector by adopting
   digital technologies, especially the digital twin (DT). After the
   analysis of the literature, the study investigates opportunities and
   challenges recognized by the market.Design/methodology/approachTo
   collect market perceptions of digital uptake in FM, the participatory
   action research (PAR) methodology is adopted as a collaborative research
   approach that involves researchers and participants working together to
   identify a problem, collect and analyze data and take action to create
   meaningful change. PAR is iteratively applied in three phases. First, a
   comparison approach analyses three literature and two case studies.
   Second, a questionnaire survey retrieves insights from the market.
   Finally, interviews to FM operators are conducted to discuss the
   outcomes of the previous two phases.FindingsSurvey results and case
   studies comparison highlight growing interest in DT but a gap in its
   implementation. DT has the potential to transform FM by enhancing
   efficiency, predictive maintenance, energy optimization and lifecycle
   management. However, adoption is hindered by high costs, integration
   challenges and the need for specialized training. Case studies emphasize
   the importance of data-driven decision-making and clear client
   objectives. While Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and Big
   Data are key enablers, issues like data processing and interoperability
   remain. Overcoming these barriers will require standardization, cost
   reduction and workforce upskilling, making strategic investment in
   digital transformation crucial for long-term
   sustainability.Originality/valueThis paper elaborates a comprehensive
   assessment of FM readiness for digital transformation through the
   adoption of DT. By combining literature analysis, case studies
   comparison, surveys and interviews, the study provides a relevant
   perspective on the opportunities and challenges associated with DT
   implementation, bridging the gap between academic research and market
   operations.},

Title = {BIM-Based Method for the Verification of Building Code Compliance},
Journal = {APPLIED SYSTEM INNOVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Urban planning is a valuable tool for growth control and city
   development, both to maintain the local urban identity and provide life
   quality for inhabitants. To regulate it, local governments have defined
   standards for a proper city's growth through municipal and detailed
   urban plans. Such instruments identify a set of rules which
   constructions and buildings must fulfil for a careful and smooth
   integration within the urban areas. New projects are required to comply
   with such rules, and designers must adapt and guarantee that their
   projects fulfil all the local urban requirements. However, the
   verification process of construction projects is still a manual
   procedure and often a time-consuming process, with high possibilities
   for inaccurate measures. Thus, this paper aims to streamline the
   verification procedure of construction projects' code compliance to
   enhance project design efficiency and save designers time. To do so, the
   Building Information Modelling (BIM) method will be used through the
   Dynamo programming software. By creating a Dynamo routine to check the
   building code and urban plan compliance from Brazilian municipalities,
   specific BIM models will be automatically analysed to detect and
   evaluate if it is according to local urban legislation. Results have
   provided a real-time decision support tool, where designers can assess
   if their buildings are complying with local urban codes at any time of
   the design stage, making it easy to innovate and integrate innovative
   design options, as well as to precisely communicate their buildings'
   code compliance. Such a method can also support municipality authorities
   to verify project compliance, reducing assessment and calculation
   errors, as well as the required time and bureaucracy for project
   appraisal.},

   detection by directly integrating it into BIM models. In addition, the
   importance of expert knowledge in determining the extinguishing agent
   type of a fire extinguisher is addressed to verify and, if necessary,
   correct the prediction of an AI-based fire safety inspection. The
   developed AI applications aim to increase the level of automation in

Abstract = {Modern building automation systems implement plenty of advanced control
   and monitoring functions that consider various parameters like users'
   activity, lighting, temperature changes, etc. Moreover, novel solutions
   based on the Internet of Things and cloud services are also being
   developed for smart buildings to ensure comfort of use, user safety,
   energy efficiency improvements, and integration with smart grids and
   smart city platforms. Such a wide spectrum of technologies and functions
   requires a novel approach in building automation systems design to
   provide effective implementation and flexibility during operation. At
   the same time, in the building design and operation industries, tools
   based on building information modeling and digital twins are being
   developed. This paper discusses the development directions and
   application areas of these solutions, identifying new trends and
   possibilities of their use in smart homes and buildings. In particular,
   the focus is on procedures for selecting automation functions, effective
   integration, and interoperability of building management systems with
   the Internet of Things, considering the organization of prediction
   mechanisms and dynamic functional changes in buildings and smart
   networks. Chosen solutions and functions should consider the

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The construction industry is slow to adopt new technologies. The
   implementation of digital technologies and remote operations using
   robots were considered farfetched affairs and unbelievable approaches.
   However, the effect of COVID-19 on clients and construction companies
   put high pressure on construction managers to seek digital solutions and
   justified the need for remote operating or distant controlling
   technologies. This paper aims to investigate the state of play in
   construction technology implementation and presents a roadmap for
   developing and implementing required technologies for the construction
   industry. The COVID-19 disruption required new methods of working safely
   and remotely and coincided with the advent of advanced automation and
   autonomous technologies. This paper aims to identify gaps and 11
   disruptive technologies that may lead to upheaval and transformation of
   the construction sector, perhaps in this decade. A road map for
   technology implementation can be helpful in developing business
   strategies at the organizational level as a theoretical measure, and it
   can facilitate the technology implementation process at the industry
   level as a practical measure. The roadmap can be used as a framework for
   policymakers to set industry or company strategies for the next 10 years
   (2030).},

Abstract = {The current computer technology facilitates the processing of large
   volumes of information in architectural design teams, in parallel with
   recent advances in-flight automation in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   along with lower costs, facilitates their use to capture aerial
   photographs and obtain orthophotographs and 3D models of relief and
   terrain textures. With these technologies, 3D models can be produced
   that allow different geometric configurations of the distribution of
   construction elements on the ground to be analyzed. This article
   presents the process of implementation in a terrain integrated into the
   early stages of architectural design. A methodology is proposed that
   covers the detailed capture of terrain, the relationship with the
   architectural design environment, and its implementation on the plot. As
   a novelty, an inverse perspective to the remaining disciplines is
   presented, from the inside of the object to the outside. The proposed
   methodology for the use of UAVs integrates terrain capture, generation
   of the 3D mesh, superimposition of environmental realities and
   architectural design using building information modeling (BIM)
   technologies. In addition, it represents the beginning of a line of
   research on the implementation of the plot and the layout of foundations
   using UAVs. The results obtained in the study carried out in three
   different projects comparing traditional technologies with the
   integration of UAVs + BIM show a clear improvement in the second option.
   The use of new technologies applied to the execution and control of work
   not only improves accuracy but also reduces errors and saves time, which
   undoubtedly indicates significant savings in costs and deviations in the
   project.},

Abstract = {One of the main benefits of Building Information Modelling is the
   capability of improving the decision-making process thanks performing
   what-if tests on digital twins of the building to be realized. Pairing
   BIM models to Building Energy Models allows designers to determine in
   advance the energy consumption of the building, improving sustainability
   of the construction. The challenge is to consider as many elements
   involved in the energy balance as possible and shuffling their
   parameters within a certain range. In this work, the automatic creation
   of a relevant set of design options to be analyzed for searching the
   optimum has been carried out. Firstly, the usual workflow that would be
   applied manually has been automatically followed by running scripts and
   codes, depending just on the initial setup given by the user. Although
   the procedure is very resource consuming, the main advancement relies in
   the reduction of the manual intervention and the possibility of creating
   large datasets of design options, avoiding gross errors. Secondly,
   Artificial Neural Networks and Transfer Learning techniques are applied
   to speed up the process of dataset creation. With such approach, the
   same dataset has been created, with about 30\% of initial data and
   without significant loss of accuracy.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {383-406},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose is two-fold: (1) to explore the interactions of
   robotic systems and lean construction in the context of offsite
   construction (OC) that were addressed in the literature published
   between 2008 and 2019 and (2) to identify the gaps in such interactions
   while discussing how addressing those gaps can benefit not only OC but
   the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry as a
   whole. Design/methodology/approach First, a systematic literature review
   (SLR) identified journal papers addressing the interactions of
   automation and lean in OC. Then, the researchers focused the analysis on
   the under-researched subtopic of robotic systems. The focused analysis
   includes discussing the interactions identified in the SLR through a
   matrix of interactions and utilizing literature beyond the previously
   identified articles for future research directions on robotic systems
   and lean construction in OC. Findings The study found 35 journal papers
   that addressed automation and lean in the context of OC. Most of the
   identified literature focused on interactions of BIM and lean
   construction, while only nine focused on the interactions of robotic
   systems and lean construction. Identified literature related to robotic
   systems mainly addressed robots and automated equipment. Additional
   interactions were identified in the realm of wearable devices, unmanned
   aerial vehicles/automated guided vehicles and digital
   fabrication/computer numerical control (CNC) machines. Originality/value
   This is one of the first studies dedicated to exploring the interactions
   of robotic systems and lean construction in OC. Also, it proposes a
   categorization for construction automation and a matrix of interactions
   between construction automation and lean construction.},

Title = {Envisioning a strategic framework to streamline building operation,
   sustainability and users' disease control},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {195-227},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This study aims to present a strategic framework aiming to streamline
   building operation and sustainability issues. To make available a
   further contribution to respond to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
   an operational prevention guideline relying on the level of spread risk
   has also been developed, primarily intended for users when accessing and
   circulating within common spaces of buildings in general.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The research approach involved the development of a whole theory,
   essentially based on a qualitative design, by means of tree schematic
   representations and explanatory frames. It presents part of a model
   already developed (called SIAPME), although, in general, besides
   integrating the underlying aspects of the individual experience of daily
   life, it is based on insights and impressions taken from the literature
   review.
   Findings
   With an identity of its own, this study offers an overview of an
   alternative set of well-founded and integrated strategies to improve
   working processes in a number of fields of the building operation
   function. A structured vision has thus, been provided with interest in
   certain key topics of the present time, such as energy management,
   comfort and sustainability. Still, in this context, based on a frame of
   knowledge gathered to date, a current, innovative and simple guidance
   has also been designed to help prevent the contagion of COVID-19.
   Research limitations/implications
   The draft of procedures is part of an ambitious goal to serve as a
   well-founded strategic basis for the eventual development of an advanced
   software solution. As it is mainly limited to qualitative analysis, from
   which themes and generalisations have been arranged, this research may
   need more empirical evidence and additional work will be necessary to
   overcome any gaps that may be found.
   Practical implications
   An overall assessment of this study seems to corroborate the idea that a
   significant impact on the developments in building operation can occur
   if stakeholders seek a more integrated way of management, based on
   cross-referencing of current issues. At a time when great uncertainties
   remain and knowledge advances are in full swing, the designed framework
   aims to be an added input towards already existing research.
   Furthermore, it can be seen as a valuable contribution to improving
   related software applications.
   Originality/value
   The originality lies in trying to better understand how and in which
   aspects the general day-to-day management of building operation can be
   handled more effectively, sustainable and framed, following a reasoned
   scientific line, in addition of trying to figure out greater capacity to
   deal with users' contagions, especially in the existing context of the
   pandemic.},

Abstract = {Digitalization, enhancing operational performance and promoting
   data-driven practices, is gaining prominence globally. However, its
   adoption in the construction industry, particularly in developing
   countries like India, is still in its infancy. This study explores the
   role and impact of digital twins, a key component of digital
   transformation, in the Indian construction sector. A cross-sectional
   study was conducted using qualitative and quantitative methods,
   collecting data from various roles within organizations primarily
   engaged in building information modeling. The aim is to understand the
   feasibility, acceptability, and adaptability of digital twins in the
   construction sector. Results indicate that identified factors positively
   influence these constructs. Despite a preference for human intervention,
   the study predicts significant traction for automated methods in the
   Indian construction sector. The survey factors strongly influence the
   feasibility, acceptability, and adaptability of digital twins in Indian
   construction organizations, demonstrating the potential to adapt and
   incorporate innovative technologies throughout the project lifecycle.
   Despite risks and challenges, Indian construction firms can adopt
   digital twins in projects.},

Title = {Automation of embodied carbon calculation in digital built

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {298},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Global and governmental pressures have been acting as motivators towards
   delivering sustainable and low carbon buildings. One of the main sources
   responsible for carbon in buildings is embodied carbon that depends on
   material choices. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology developed
   to assess the materials, using embodied factors throughout the whole
   life cycle of the material. Although there are promising possibilities
   for incorporating LCA with building information modelling platforms,
   dynamic, early design assessment and automated integration still
   lacking. This paper proposes a novel framework and tool for automating
   embodied carbon calculations within the BIM environment. The approach
   leverages literature reviews and hands-on exploration to establish the
   foundation of a BIM-integrated LCA tool. The proposed tool aims to
   provide vital information for informed decision-making, minimizing
   errors, and facilitating low carbon building design. Ultimately, this
   framework could enhance early decision making, reduce error, time,
   effort and accelerate iterative design assessment.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Abstract = {Previous studies have investigated frameworks for the specification of
   Exchange Information Requirements (EIRs). So far, these efforts have
   concentrated on the specification of non-geometrical data. Graphical
   information specification is often carried out through the application
   of subjective criteria. Moreover, the definition of variables used in
   existing specification frameworks has acquired various meanings among
   practitioners and organisations. To address this gap, this study's aim
   is to identify and analyse the concepts that influence the specification
   of the graphical data in BIM-enabled projects. The BIM literature tends
   to consider problems from a technological standpoint. The current
   dichotomy in the BIM body of knowledge demands research that account for
   the context of industry practices and organisations in which the
   specification of graphical data is performed. To address its aim, this
   study adopts a qualitative strategy, employing a cross-sectional design
   and a grounded theory approach for data collection and analysis. The
   iterative nature of the grounded theory approach, particularly of its
   theoretical sampling feature, was addressed by dividing data collection
   and analysis into two stages. In exploring the concepts that define the
   specification of graphical data in EIRs, six main themes were
   identified: model use, project stage, project actors, processes and
   objects definitions, graphical granularity, and model attribute.
   Moreover, the findings support the suggestion that contextual factors
   play a role in the implementation of these variables and associated
   processes. There is a suggestion that practices at the industry and
   organisational context level, such as the existence of mandates, could
   be influencing the way practitioners specify information. These results
   can be employed to extend the understanding of the considerations made
   in the definition of graphical information in EIRs documentation.
   Moreover, this work could inform the activity of practitioners and the
   development of new technologies focused on the automation of information
   specification.},

   building information models},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a key enabler to support
   integration of building data within the buildings life cycle (BLC) and
   is an important aspect to support a wide range of use cases, related to
   intelligent automation, navigation, energy efficiency, sustainability
   and so forth. Open building data faces several challenges related to
   standardization, data interdependency, data access, and security. In
   addition to these technical challenges, there remains the barrier among
   BIM developers who wish to protect their intellectual property, as full
   3D BIM development requires expertise and effort. This means that there
   is often limited availability of building data. However, a Linked Data
   approach to BIM, combined with a supporting national geospatial
   identifier infrastructure makes interlinking and controlled sharing of
   BIM models possible. In Ireland, the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi)
   maintains a substantial data set, called Prime2, which includes not only
   building GIS data (polygon footprint, geodetic coordinate), but also
   additional building specific data (e.g. form, function and status). The
   data set also includes change information, recording when changes took
   place and who captured and validated those changes. This paper presents
   the development of a national geospatial identifier infrastructure based
   on an OSi building ontology that supports capturing OSi building data
   using Resource Description Framework (RDF). The paper details the
   different steps required to generate the ontology and publish the data.
   First, an initial analysis of the data set to generate the ontology is
   discussed. This includes identification of mappings to existing
   standards, e.g. GeoSPARQL to handle geometries and PROV-O to handle
   provenance, to the development of R2RML mappings to generate the RDF and
   the method for deploying the ontology and the building graphs. This data
   is then made available dependent on different licensing agreements
   handled by an access control approach. Methods are then presented to
   support the interlinking of the authoritative data with other building
   data standards and data sets using geolocation, followed finally by
   discussion and future work.},

Title = {Supplier-contractor coordination approach to managing demand
   fluctuations of ready-mix concrete},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Although advancements have been made in the management of projects due
   to the digitalization and automation technologies, the efficient use of
   digital data is still lacking for the coordination of the supply chain.
   This paper presents an approach that allows data-driven and
   schedule-oriented supply chain coordination in the face of demand
   fluctuations. The approach consists of two main steps that contractors
   should take: 1) monitor the demand fluctuations based on a 4D model that
   captures the as-built status and updated look-ahead schedules, 2) make
   decisions to modify original orders to accommodate the demand
   fluctuations where orders are determined by a heuristic evolutionary
   algorithm. As a proof of concept, the coordination approach is
   demonstrated using an example project featuring a five-day in-situ
   construction of concrete walls. Results from this example show that
   using the approach improves the responsiveness of concrete planning and
   ordering. As a result, this leads to improved collaboration between
   suppliers and contractors in construction projects.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Construction robotics has emerged as a leading technology in the
   construction industry. This paper conducts an innovative dual-track
   quantitative comprehensive method to analyze the current literature and
   assess future trends. First, a bibliometric review of 955 journal
   articles published between 1974 and 2023 was performed, exploring
   keywords, journals, countries, and clusters. Furthermore, a neural topic
   model based on BERTopic addresses topic modeling repetition issues. The
   study identifies building information modeling (BIM), human-robot
   collaboration (HRC), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as ``three
   pillars{''} in the field. Additionally, we systematically reviewed the
   relevant literature and nested symbiotic relationships. The outcome of
   this study is twofold: first, the findings provide quantitative and
   qualitative scientific guidance for future research on trends; second,
   the innovative dual-track quantitative analysis research methodology
   simultaneously stimulates critical thinking about the modeling of other
   similarly trending topics characterized to avoid high degree of
   homogeneity and corpus overlap.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Fast transmission of COVID-19 led to mass cancelling of events to
   contain the virus outbreak. Amid lockdown restrictions, a vast number of
   construction projects came to a halt. Robotic platforms can perform
   construction projects in an unmanned manner, thus ensuring the essential
   construction tasks are not suspended during the pandemic. This research
   developed a BIM-based prototype, including a task planning algorithm and
   a motion planning algorithm, to assist in the robotic assembly of
   COVID-19 hospitalisation light weight structures with prefabricated
   components. The task planning algorithm can determine the assembly
   sequence and coordinates for various types of prefabricated components.
   The motion planning algorithm can generate robots' kinematic parameters
   for performing the assembly of the prefabricated components. Testing of
   the prototype finds that it has satisfactory performance in terms of 1)
   the reasonableness of assembly sequence determined, 2) reachability for
   the assembly coordinates of prefabricated components, and 3) capability
   to avoid obstacles.},

   protocol of indoor art design and home wireless network, so as to
   achieve residential comfort and wireless data security transmission and
   convenient, real-time monitoring. This paper starts with many
   environmental parameters that are closely related to human comfort, such
   as temperature and humidity, light, and air cleanliness, and conducts an
   investigation on the comfort of intelligent houses and the appreciation
   of modern indoor art; this paper discusses the security of BIM and
   ZigBee and the algorithm of AES starting from the specific
   implementation process; according to the internal characteristics and
   password requirements of the family, a smart home safety net is
   constructed and encrypted, so as to ensure the safe transmission of

Title = {A framework for smart construction contracts using BIM and blockchain},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Poor payment practices are perceived as one of the biggest challenges
   facing the construction industry. Since payments are issued according to
   project contract terms, the project's cash flow is inherently affected
   by the contract and how parties fulfill their obligations. This research
   proposes a framework for payment automation in construction projects to
   achieve smart construction contracts. Payments are automatically issued
   upon satisfying contract conditions using blockchain. Cryptocurrency is
   proposed to be utilized in the framework to execute the contract terms
   with no need for a third party to process project payments. 5D BIM is
   used to model the geometry of buildings and visualize project progress
   together with payment status using Autodesk Revit, Navisworks, and
   Primavera P6. The developed framework has the potential to reduce the
   consequences of poor payments. An actual case study for a construction
   project in Cairo, Egypt is worked out to demonstrate the main features
   of the proposed framework. The results of the case study reveal that
   project cash flow is secured and payments are instantly issued.
   Moreover, electronic records of payments are kept on the blockchain.},

Title = {Semi-automated generation of parametric BIM for steel structures based
   on terrestrial laser scanning data},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {112},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As-built building information models (BIMs) are increasingly needed for
   construction project handover and facility management. To create
   as-built BIMs, laser scanning technology has gained popularity in the
   recent decades due to its high measurement accuracy and high measurement
   speed. However, most existing methods for creating as-built BIMs from
   laser scanning data involve plenty of manual work, thus becoming labor
   intensive and time consuming. To address the problems, this study
   presents a semi-automated approach that can obtain required parameters
   to create as-built BIMs for steel structures with complex connections
   from terrestrial laser scanning data. An algorithm based on principal
   component analysis (PCA) and cross-section fitting techniques is
   developed to retrieve the position and direction of each circular
   structural component from scanning data. An image-assisted edge point
   extraction algorithm is developed to effectively extract the boundaries
   of planar structural components. Normal-based region growing algorithm
   and random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm are adopted to model the
   connections between structural components. The proposed approach was
   validated on a bridge-like steel structure with four different types of
   structural components. The extracted asbuilt geometry was compared with
   the as-designed geometry to validate the accuracy of the proposed
   approach. The results showed that the proposed approach could
   efficiently and accurately extract the geometry information and generate
   parametric BIMs of steel structures.},

Abstract = {The construction industry has been notoriously slow to adopt new
   technology and embrace automation. This has resulted in lower efficiency
   and productivity compared to other industries where automation has been
   widely adopted. However, recent advancements in robotics and artificial
   intelligence offer a potential solution to this problem. In this study,
   a methodology is proposed to integrate multirobotic systems in
   construction projects with the aim of increasing efficiency and
   productivity. The proposed approach involves the use of multiple robot
   and human agents (HA) working collaboratively to complete a construction
   task. The methodology was tested through a case study that involved 3D
   digitization of a small, occluded space using two robots and one HA. The
   results show that integrating multiagent robotic systems (MARS) in
   construction can effectively overcome challenges and complete tasks
   efficiently. The implications of this study suggest that MARS could
   revolutionize the industry.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a proposal for a national building
   standard in Sweden. We define requirements for the proposed standard,
   e.g., it should support development of 3D city models, connect to
   building information models (BIM) and national registers and be based on
   a national classification system for the urban environment. Based on
   these requirements we develop an Application Domain Extension (ADE) of
   the building model in the proposed CityGML 3.0 standard denoted CityGML
   Sve-Test. CityGML 3.0 includes several new features of interest, e.g.,
   the space concept, enhanced possibilities to convert data, and to link
   to other standards. In our study we create test data according to
   CityGML Sve-Test and evaluate it against the requirements. It is shown
   that BIM models (in Industry Foundation Classes, IFC, format) can be
   converted to CityGML Sve-Test and that a classification system
   facilitates this conversion. The CityGML Sve-Test dataset can be used to
   increase the automation level in building permissions checking and a
   related study shows that CityGML 3.0 has capabilities to link to legal
   information and be a base for 3D cadastral index maps. Based on our
   experience, we suggest that the national building standard should
   conform to international standards and, if possible, include a
   classification system. The exchange format (GML, JSON etc.) might
   change, but to be based on a standardized data model ensures harmonized
   structures and concepts.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {262},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD) was launched to transform the approach
   to construction through the implementation of digital technologies.
   Whilst technologies have the potential to improve project performance,
   there are limited studies on IDD in the context of the construction
   industry. Hence, this study investigates the level of IDD implementation
   and the perceived improvements on project performance. Based on the
   literature review, 32 digital and cloud technologies have been
   identified and formed the basis for a structured survey questionnaire,
   which was distributed to target respondents covering the major roles of
   the construction industry in Singapore. The responses were analyzed to
   determine the existing level of IDD implementation and the perceived
   improvements in project performance contributed by IDD implementation,
   followed by post-survey interviews to validate the findings from the
   survey. The study found that only 38.71\% of the organizations
   implemented IDD technologies in all four IDD phases. BIM,
   prefabrication, BIM-to-field mobile applications and building management
   system were the most frequently used technologies in the four phases
   respectively. The respondents largely agreed that IDD implementation
   improved overall project, project cost, project quality and project
   schedule performance. The findings from this study provide better
   understanding of the existing level of IDD implementation and the
   perceived improvements in project performance, serving as a starting
   point for future research on increasing IDD implementation. (C) 2020

   Project},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},

Abstract = {Architects face the challenge of exploring various design solutions in
   the early design stage, often with conflicting optimization goals. To
   tackle this complexity, they need to rely on tools and methodologies
   during the conceptual phase to assess and optimize designs, considering
   multiple aspects of building performance. Parametric Design, Generative
   Design, and automation in Building Information Modelling (BIM) offer
   architects new opportunities to work on complex buildings. These
   advancements empower designers to enhance their designs, increase
   project efficiency, improve performance, and reduce project time and
   costs. Multi-Objective Optimization algorithms are employed to address
   conflicting objectives in the design process. The GENIUS project
   introduces an Algorithm-Aided Design workflow that optimizes the
   building shape and Window-to-Wall Ratio of an office building,
   considering energy and daylight performance. The integration of BIM
   software, visual programming tools, and Artificial Intelligence
   techniques (Genetic Algorithms and RBFOpt model-based optimization)
   allows architects to identify optimal solutions aligning with design
   objectives. The workflow was validated through a case study of a large
   office building, focusing on maximizing daylight performance using the
   Spatial Daylight Autonomy metric and minimizing energy consumption using
   the Energy Use Intensity metric. The GENIUS project equips architects
   with a methodology and toolset to improve their designs and identify
   optimal solutions for complex design challenges.},

Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The global building sector plays a pivotal role in addressing
   sustainability, climate change, and carbon neutrality. This study
   introduces the original concept of virtual building models (VBMs)
   throughout the lifecycle of the building industry, considering the
   unique characteristics of this industry. VBMs are defined as
   mathematical models that represent the physical behavior of buildings
   throughout their lifecycle. These models consist of subvirtual models
   that represent the physical operational environments of the target
   building, encompassing physical variables, equipment, systems, indoor
   environments, and structural and material behaviors. This concept can
   contribute to achieving the existing concepts of building information
   modeling, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems within building
   operations, communities, and environments. In this study, building
   models are categorized into five aspects: virtual model environments,
   types, interactions, integrations, and levels of detail (LODs). The LODs
   are classified into five levels (LOD100, LOD200, LOD300, LOD350, and
   LOD400) depending on the primary environments of the virtual models and
   their coverage across the entire building. Virtual modeling
   methodologies are proposed considering the virtual model aspects to
   achieve higher or intended LOD states from both academic and industrial
   perspectives. Finally, future research directions are discussed to drive
   the concept of virtual buildings to shape the future of the building
   industry through digital transformations.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {141},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Technology adoption is pivotal for the productivity growth in
   construction industry. This research paper attempts to fill this gap by
   addressing the following research objectives. First, the predictor
   factors stimulating project managers' adoption of construction
   automation innovations are rigorously analyzed using a mixed approach
   combining a systematic literature review, a knowledgeable panel, and a
   survey questionnaire. Secondly, the study implements a light deep
   learning model to track the progress of reinforcing bar placements by
   verifying completed rebar ties. By linking the progress of the bar to a
   single binary condition, the number of classes needed to train the
   neural network drops to only two resulting in a light CNN with a recall
   rate of 89.2\% and precision rate of 95.7\%. This model can be
   implemented on a low power GPU, making it more cost efficient and
   simpler to adopt on site. A similar approach can be used on other
   critical activities in construction. This approach can aid inspections,
   quality control, in combination with drones or robotic systems. The
   proposed system integrates the most important factors of a successful
   adoption by providing a proof of concept with potential use cases in
   construction sites.},

Abstract = {The digital transformation in management of the built environment is
   more and more evident. While the benefits of location data, from
   Building Information Modelling or Geographical Information Systems, have
   been explored separately, their combination - GeoBIM - in asset
   management has never been explored. Data collection for condition
   assessment is challenging due to quantity, types, frequency and quality
   of data. We first describe the opportunities and challenges of GeoBIM
   for condition assessment. The theoretical approach is then validated
   developing an integrated GeoBIM model of the digital built environment,
   for a neighbourhood in Milan, Italy. Data are collected, linked,
   processed and analysed, through multiple software platforms, providing
   relevant information for asset management decision making. Good results
   are achieved in rapid massive data collection, improved visualisation,
   and analysis. While further testing and development is required, the
   case study outcomes demonstrated the innovation and the mid-term
   service-oriented potential of the proposed approach.},

Title = {A novel framework for set-based steel connection design automation},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& STRUCTURES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {298},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Existing computational design tools for steel connection design
   predominantly employ a point -based design (PBD) approach, which
   requires iterative re-evaluation whenever there are changes in design
   specifications. This paper introduces a new framework that adopts a set
   -based design (SBD) approach, aiming to substantially reduce the
   iteration and time cost associated with steel connection design and
   rework. The framework integrates a component -set connection design
   model with a database storage and query -based data retrieval method.
   The first method enables the flexible and efficient generation of a
   large connection design space from all possible component combinations,
   and automated identification of valid connection configurations within
   it. The latter method allows for automated design space refinement from
   preference -based evaluation of connection design efficiency and
   high-speed comparison and selection of optimal connection designs. To
   evaluate the relative performance of SBD and PBD approaches, the
   framework is applied to a steel floor system design case study with 62
   connections. Results showed that the SBD approach achieved near
   -instantaneous connection design automation, with a total execution time
   of fewer than 55 milliseconds, making it over 10 times faster than the
   corresponding PBD approach.},

Title = {Toward Life Cycle Sustainability in Infrastructure: The Role of
   Automation and Robotics in PPP Projects},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This article identifies how project life cycle characteristics and
   automation and robotic technologies influence the sustainability of
   public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects. The result of
   the article is a model of how public and private collaborations can
   leverage technology and project organization to make infrastructure more
   sustainable. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the model
   subdivides sustainability into engineering, project management,
   environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Engineering
   sustainability concerns the applicability of technologies to
   infrastructure PPP sustainability. The project management sustainability
   is decisive for ultimately creating environmental, social and economic
   sustainability within and beyond infrastructure PPP projects. The model
   identifies that the procurement phase is of particular importance for
   sustainable infrastructure PPPs. Successful sustainable infrastructure
   procurement likely includes such factors as increased transparency,
   participation, and stable, capable project alliances with a shared
   vision and clear goals. The model also identifies that, throughout the
   whole project life cycle, actions in the form of collaboration,
   experimentation and platformization promote sustainability. The findings
   in this article add to the understanding of how transformation toward
   increased sustainability can be achieved by individual organizations,
   their network, and ecosystems of public, private and civic actors.},

Title = {Digital mock-ups as support tools for preventing risks related to energy
   sources in the operation stage of industrial facilities through design},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) and product lifecycle management
   (PLM) technologies provide automatic model checking (AMC) tools that can
   be used for the prevention of occupational health and safety (OHS) risks
   through design (PtD). Considering that the risks related to energy
   sources during the operation stage of industrial facilities can be
   major, our objective is to propose a PtD approach for this type of risk
   that uses AMC tools. For this purpose, our methodology is based on the
   information systems design-science paradigm. Considering that both BIM
   and PLM mock-ups can be used to design industrial facilities and that
   Catia V5 is one of the main software programs used to design industrial
   equipment and facilities, our methodology specifically includes a
   comparative literature review of the uses of AMC tools to check BIM and
   PLM mock-ups and a comparative study of the OHS risk prevention
   capabilities of the AMC tools available in Catia V5. Therefore, the PtD
   approach that we propose is specific to Catia V5. It consists of: 1)
   extracting rules related to hazardous energy control from regulatory
   requirements and classifying them according to their automation
   potential, 2) expressing the rules in a form that is compatible with the
   RASE method, 3) interpreting the rules using the RASE method, and 4)
   using a macro script to automatically check the compliance of the
   digital mock-ups. The proposed approach's contri-bution is that it makes
   it possible to support facility designers in automatically identifying
   hazardous energy sources in systems. In future studies, we intend to
   couple this PtD approach with methods that integrate dynamic system
   behavior to assess the level of risk corresponding to the hazardous
   sources identified.},

Title = {A BIM based tool for evaluating building renovation strategies: the case
   of three demonstration sites in different European countries},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {PurposeBuildings are among the biggest contributors to environmental
   impacts. To achieve energy-saving and decarbonisation objectives while
   also improving living conditions, it is imperative to undertake
   large-scale renovations of existing buildings, which constitute the
   greater part of building stock and have relatively low energy
   efficiency. However, building renovation projects poses significant
   challenges owing to the absence of optimised tools and methods for
   planning and executing renovation works, coupled with the need for a
   high degree of interaction with
   occupants.Design/methodology/approachThis paper describes the
   development of an automated process, based on building information
   modelling (BIM) and the principal component analysis method, for
   overcoming building renovation challenges. The process involves the
   assessment and simulation of renovation scenarios in terms of duration,
   cost, effort needed and disruptive potential. The proposed process was
   tested in three case studies; multi-residence apartment buildings
   comprising different construction components and systems, located in
   Greece, France and Denmark, on which six different renovation strategies
   were evaluated using sensitivity analysis.FindingsThe developed tool was
   successfully able to model and simulate the six renovation scenarios
   across the three demonstration sites. The ability to simulate various
   renovation scenarios for a given project can help to strategise
   renovation interventions based on selected key performance indicators as
   well as their correlation at two different levels: the building level
   and the renovated surface area level.Originality/valueThe objectives of
   this paper are twofold: firstly, to present an automated process, using
   BIM, for evaluating and comparing renovation scenarios in terms of
   duration, cost, workers needed and disruptive potential; next, to show
   the subsequent testing of the process and the analysis of its
   applicability and behaviour when applied on three live demonstration
   sites located in three different European countries (France, Greece and
   Denmark), involving six renovation scenarios.},

Title = {Augmenting progress monitoring in soil-foundation construction utilizing
   SOLOv2-based instance segmentation and visual BIM representation},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {155},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Efficient management of construction progress requires regular progress
   tracking, but monitoring progress on a daily basis can be both
   time-consuming and labor-intensive since the meticulous manual data
   processing is involved. Soil-foundation construction entails multiple
   uncertain underground safety risks, the elimination of which requires
   significant time and effort, thereby increasing the likelihood of
   schedule overruns. Automation and augmentation of progress monitoring
   are necessary for soil-foundation construction. There are two primary
   research challenges in the context of soil-foundation construction: the
   precise differentiation of objects with similar apparent
   characteristics, and the accurate detection of partially obscured
   objects. The existing approaches primarily address such issues by image
   post-processing rather than augmenting image feature inference. To
   enhance the efficiency of progress monitoring and facilitate unmanned
   inspection, an integrated computer vision-based framework for the
   tracking of soil-foundation construction progress was proposed. An
   improved SOLOv2 was utilized to qualitatively and quantitatively
   recognize the construction progress. Subsequently, the actual and
   differential progress could be integrated into streamlined BIM based on
   a self-adaptive grid-based mapping method. The approach was applied to a
   campus building project in China, resulting in a high segmentation
   accuracy (mAP = 90.9\%). The improved SOLOv2 was found to surpass other
   state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. Further, the impact of grid
   size on the mapping accuracy of construction progress was explored. The
   present study promotes automated schedule tracking and provides a
   feasible approach for developing a digital twin of soil-foundation
   construction.},

Title = {A Hybrid Framework for Multi-Objective Construction Site Layout
   Optimization},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Effective Construction Site Layout Planning (CSLP) ensures the organized
   placement and sizing of temporary facilities, enhancing workflow and
   logistical efficiency. Poorly planned layouts, however, can increase
   material handling times, create bottlenecks, and reduce productivity,
   ultimately leading to higher costs. The main objective of this study is
   to introduce a BIM-based hybrid framework for CSLP that integrates
   Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) with a Genetic Algorithm (GA),
   developed through a Design Science Research approach. This Construction
   Site Optimization Framework (CSOF) addresses CSLP as a multi-objective
   optimization problem, prioritizing efficient positioning of facilities
   while accounting for workflow intensity, safety, and manager
   preferences. The framework's continuous-space modeling supports a
   realistic approach, moving beyond fixed-location models. Exploratory
   case studies demonstrated CSOF's effectiveness, achieving 30.79\% to
   40.98\% reductions in non-value-adding travel distances and adaptability
   across varied site conditions. In this way, this research provides a
   decision-support tool that balances automation with decision-maker
   input, enhancing layout efficiency and operational flexibility in
   construction site management.},

Title = {Deep learning-based corrosion inspection of long-span bridges with BIM
   integration},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Infrastructure operation and maintenance is essential for societal
   safety, particularly in Japan where the aging of infrastructures built
   during the period of high economic growth is advancing. However, there
   are issues such as a shortage of engineers and inefficiencies in work,
   requiring improvements in efficiency and automation for their
   resolution. Nevertheless, there are still many inefficiencies in the
   current procedures for bridge inspections. Usually, inspection engineers
   check for damage on bridges through close visual inspections at the
   site, then photograph the damaged parts, measure the size by touch, and
   create a report. A three-dimensional representation, considering the
   front and back of the structural elements, is needed for identifying
   damage, necessitating the creation of multi-directional
   three-dimensional drawings. However, this process is labor-intensive and
   prone to errors. Furthermore, due to the lack of uniformity in records,
   it is challenging to refer to past inspection histories. Especially for
   long bridges, without resolving such issues, the required labor and the
   number of mistakes could exceed acceptable limits, making proper
   management difficult. Therefore, in this study, we developed a method
   for automatically measuring the position and area of corroded parts by
   capturing images of the lower surface of the stiffening girder using a
   bridge inspection vehicle and utilizing image diagnosis technology. By
   integrating these results into a 3D model called BIM (Building
   Information Modeling), it becomes possible to manage the bridge more
   efficiently. We verified this method on actual long bridges and
   confirmed its effectiveness.},

Title = {BIM log mining: Learning and predicting design commands},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {112},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper develops a framework to learn and predict design commands
   based upon building information modeling (BIM) event log data stored in
   Autodesk Revit journal files, which has the potential to improve the
   modeling efficiency. BIM design logs, which automatically keep detailed
   records on the modeling process, are the basis of data acquisition and
   data mining. Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM NN), as a
   probabilistic deep learning model for learning sequential data with
   varying lengths from logs, is established to provide designers with
   predictions about the possible design command class in the next step. To
   demonstrate the feasibility of this method, a case study runs at large
   design logs over 4 GB from an international design firm for command
   class prediction. To begin with, useful data retrieved from logs is
   cleaned and saved in a 320 MB Comma Separated Values (CSV) file with
   totally 352,056 lines of commands over 289 projects. Subsequently,
   various design commands are categorized into 14 classes according to
   their effects and given numerical labels, which are then fed into LSTM
   NN for training and testing. As a result, the overall accuracy of this
   particular case study can reach 70.5\% in the test set, which
   outperforms some classical machine learning methods, like k nearest
   neighbor, random forest and support vector machine. This research
   contributes to applying a probabilistic LSTM NN with optimal parameters
   to learn features from designers' subjective behaviors effectively and
   predict the next possible design command class intelligently towards
   automation of the design process. Moreover, the three most possible
   command classes will be offered as the recommendations under the
   assumption that the correct class tends to appear owning the top three
   highest probabilities, which can possibly enhance the reliability of
   predictions.},

Title = {Internet of Things Enabled Data Acquisition Framework for Smart Building
   Applications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {With the networks of sophisticated sensors and devices, building systems
   have the potential to serve as the infrastructure that provides
   essential data for the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart city
   paradigm. However, current building systems lack intersystem
   connectivity or exposure to the more extensive networks of IoT devices.
   In this paper, the authors propose an IoT-enabled data acquisition
   framework that utilizes low-cost computers, sensors modules, developed
   software agents, and the existing building Wi-Fi network to establish a
   central facility database. A system prototype is developed for
   collecting and integrating facility data, and a case study on a
   university campus is conducted to demonstrate the proposed framework.
   The potential use cases enabled by the central facility database, the
   integration of building information modeling (BIM) standards and
   building system data protocols, a vision for future smart cities, and
   the challenges are also discussed. This research concludes that the
   proposed framework is effective in using IoT devices and networks to
   establish a cost-effective, platform-neutral, scalable, and portable
   building data acquisition system for smart building innovations.},

Title = {Evaluating industrial modularization strategies: Local vs. overseas
   fabrication},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {114},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Modularization is becoming more popular in industrial construction to
   enhance various project management aspects, including time, cost,
   safety, quality, and productivity. Although many studies have
   highlighted the differences between modular and conventional
   (stick-built) construction, little research is conducted to evaluate
   alternative fabrication strategies (e.g., overseas versus local
   fabrication). Some practitioners prefer to build modules locally, while
   some others prefer to outsource the module fabrication overseas and ship
   them to the industrial plant. This dramatically affects the decision on
   the size of the module envelope, and in turn, many other associated
   factors. The purpose of this study is to develop an integrated framework
   to evaluate different module fabrication strategies. This study employs
   various automation tools (e.g., building information modeling (BIM),
   simulation modeling) to quantify the impact of module fabrication
   strategies on any selected industrial project. The proposed framework
   considers various project aspects such as shipment and handling,
   fabrication, lifting, module resizing, and module assembly yard to find
   the best fabrication strategy. An actual case study, part of an
   industrial plant in Alberta, Canada, is presented in this paper to
   elucidate research contributions.},

Abstract = {This study presents a mixed-method systematic literature review (SLR)
   investigating the applications of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies for
   enhancing sustainability in transportation infrastructure projects from
   a construction perspective. A corpus of 199 scholarly articles published
   between 2009 and November 2023 was meticulously selected from the Scopus
   database. The thematic analysis categorised the publications into four
   main clusters: infrastructure type, technology types, project lifecycle
   stages, and geographic context. The scientometric analysis revealed a
   burgeoning interest in the integrating of I4.0 technologies to enhance
   sustainability-particularly environmental sustainability. Among these,
   Building Information Modelling (BIM)-related tools emerged as the most
   extensively studied domain (33.50\%), followed by the Internet of Things
   (IoT) and sensors (14\%), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) (13.22\%).
   The findings demonstrate that roads, highways, and bridges are the most
   studied infrastructure types, with BIM being predominantly utilised for
   energy assessment, sustainable design, and asset management. The main
   contributions of this review are threefold: (1) providing a
   comprehensive framework that categorises I4.0 applications and their
   sustainability impacts across transportation infrastructure types and
   project lifecycle stages, (2) identifying key technical challenges in
   integrating I4.0 technologies with sustainability assessment tools, and
   (3) revealing underexplored areas and providing clear directions for
   future research. The findings provide actionable insights for
   researchers and industry practitioners aiming to adopt integrated,
   sustainability-driven digital approaches in transport infrastructure
   delivery.},

Abstract = {Despite the subjective and error-prone nature of manual visual
   inspection procedures, this type of inspection is still a common process
   in most construction projects. However, Automated Construction
   Inspection and Progress Monitoring (ACIPM) has the potential to improve
   inspection processes. The objective of this paper is to examine the
   applications, challenges, and future directions of ACIPM in a systematic
   review. It explores various application areas of ACIPM in two domains of
   (a) transportation construction inspection, and (b) building
   construction inspection. The review identifies key ACIPM tools and
   techniques including Laser Scanning (LS), Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS),
   Robots, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Augmented Reality (AR),
   Virtual Reality (VR), Computer Vision (CV), Deep Learning, and Building
   Information Modeling (BIM). It also explores the challenges in
   implementing ACIPM, including limited generalization, data quality and
   validity, data integration, and real-time considerations. Studying legal
   implications and ethical and social impacts are among the future
   directions in ACIPM that are pinpointed in this paper. As the main
   contribution, this paper provides a comprehensive understanding of ACIPM
   for academic researchers and industry professionals.},

Title = {Automated digital modeling of existing buildings: A review of visual
   object recognition methods},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},

Abstract = {Digital building representations enable and promote new forms of
   simulation, automation, and information sharing. However, creating and
   maintaining these representations is prohibitively expensive. In an
   effort to make the adoption of this technology easier, researchers have
   been automating the digital modeling of existing buildings by applying
   reality capture devices and computer vision algorithms. This article is
   a summary of the efforts of the past ten years, with a particular focus
   on object recognition methods. We rectify three limitations of existing
   review articles by describing the general structure and variations of
   object recognition systems and performing an extensive and quantitative
   comparative performance evaluation. The coverage of building component
   classes (i.e. semantic coverage) and recognition performances are
   reported in-depth and framed using a building taxonomy. Research
   programs demonstrate sparse semantic coverage with a clear bias towards
   recognizing floor, wall, ceiling, door, and window classes.
   Comprehensive semantic coverage of building infrastructure will require
   a radical scaling and diversification of efforts.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an ontology for AFDD (Automated Fault Detection and
   Diagnostics) of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air conditioning)
   systems in buildings called ``AFDDOnto{''}. Presently, the AFDD models
   are mainly data-centric and often lack semantic information such as
   contextual information and spatial information; additionally,
   configuration information, analysis, and results used for model
   development are lost once developed. This impedes an effective mechanism
   for tracking changes and updating the model for future developments and
   use cases. The Proposed ontology can be used for AFDD model development,
   tracking changes, analytics, visualization, and digital twinning by
   enabling integration of BIM with BAS/BMS (Building Automation
   System/Building Management System) concepts and secondly to store AFDD
   configuration and analytics in the AFDDOnto. Select competency questions
   are constructed using SPARQL queries to access the proposed knowledge
   model. The proposed ontology has been tested against different measures
   using multiple metrics and a case study and further validated using a
   semi-structured survey of experts. Applied AI engineers, Facility
   managers, Asset managers, and building owners aiming to develop AFDD
   models for HVAC systems can benefit from adopting this ontology for HVAC
   maintenance, including analysis, model development, and knowledge
   management.},

Title = {SVD-based point cloud 3D stone by stone segmentation for cultural
   heritage structural analysis-The case of the Apollo Temple at Delphi},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Unprecedented growth in 3D reality-based capturing devices - such as
   Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) or Unnamed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
   equipped with high-resolution cameras, followed by photogrammetry 3D
   metrics reconstruction - has revolutionized the way Architectural,
   Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector operates. Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) naturally emerged as the only viable
   alternative for managing this type of heterogeneous information.
   Unfortunately, despite the foreseen increase in BIM used in the heritage
   sector, known as Historic BIM (HBIM), high fidelity and increased
   resolution mesh output still need to be revised in BIM platforms. This
   inability of end users to handle meshed surfaces operates as a
   bottleneck to HBIM expansion and progression. Therefore, various
   research endeavours are exploring the latest state-of-the-art Machine
   Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for large-scale class
   recognition, leaving thus a gap in how to dismantle low-represented
   small objects. In this approach, this manuscript presents and validates
   a concrete methodology that utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
   for boundary plane detection and mesh segmentation, which, as validated
   herein, reaches stone-level accuracy. The presented methodology leaves
   geometry intact, does not require mesh conversion, data transformations
   or additional channel input such as or colour or texture. Based on the
   findings of this research, state-of-the-art research efforts now
   consolidate towards high applicability and easy-to-generalize procedures
   that could reach stone-by-stone reverse engineering alternatives
   speeding up and broadening the otherwise time-and-labour plus
   resource-intensive Scan-to-BIM plans. The results disclose that, under a
   real case scenario of a heavily ruined monument where common
   architectural treaties are at stake, the developed algorithm can detect
   and detach elements robustly from the scene and then, as the next step,
   it efficiently applies a stone-by-stone segmentation for each
   columnresembling instance, with an overall accuracy of 90\%. This
   easy-to-implement and simple-to-optimize approach is a viable auxiliary
   tool for multi-layer and multi-resolution automation frameworks, with or
   without machine learning deployment.(c) 2023 Consiglio Nazionale delle

Abstract = {Considering the significant amount of time and money wasted yearly in
   fixing errors caused by miscommunication and inadequate information on
   project sites, relaying the knowledge of field experts through design
   software may reduce communication-based conflicts in projects. This
   study aimed to create a model to integrate human field expertise in the
   construction process with building information modeling (BIM) software.
   This study is based on the premise of the significance of human
   involvement in construction. Basement construction in Fargo, North
   Dakota, was the construction scenario selected for scrutiny in this
   study. Surveys and in-person interviews were conducted with local
   contractors to ascertain valuable recommendations and views on basement
   construction in Fargo. Information from these contractors was coded into
   models to offer warnings and recommendations on the assessed basement
   construction activities to help architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) professionals with design, planning, and other
   processes required before and during construction. Combining BIM (with
   all its proven strengths) with the human aspect of construction will
   significantly improve the construction process, especially in
   decision-making and risk mitigation.},

Title = {Digital twins for decoding human-building interaction in multi-domain
   test-rooms for environmental comfort and energy saving via graph
   representation},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {279},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Human comfort studies are a complex topic given their interdisciplinary
   and multi-stimuli nature. The integration of different sources of
   information from multi-domain experiments for occupants' environ-mental
   perception investigation can change the way that researchers perceived
   the interactions among building agents. This study aims to establish a
   new method for digital twin development from a test room for
   human-comfort and energy behavior analysis, through a Graph Neural
   Network. An as-monitored BIM model was integrated with monitoring
   information, i.e., environmental data from the facility, physiolog-ical
   signals, and survey answers from occupants, and the relationships
   between the building agents were outlined, based on the experiment
   purposes. A real-world experiment was adopted to demonstrate the
   procedure and results, connecting the information from experiments and a
   test room facility employed to the study. The original approach filled a
   recurrent gap in human-comfort studies: the integration of all the
   sources of information in a single visual platform through Graph Neural
   Networks, allowing the recognition of patterns, connections, and the
   influence of the diverse stimuli in the human perception of the
   surrounding environment. In complex building systems, with large sensing
   structures, high occu-pancy and multi-source environmental stimuli, new
   conclusions can be drawn to a full understanding of the human-building
   interactions.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The term ``digital twin{''} is becoming increasingly prevalent in both
   research and politics with regard to infrastructure structures. Industry
   is making significant advancements in the fields of automation and
   autonomy. While numerous definitions are in circulation, some of which
   are identical, many are similar in nature. This work examines the
   digital twin from its original industry perspective and considers its
   relevance to the constructional engineering sector. The objective of
   this study is to provide an overview of the current approaches in the
   Industry 4.0 and constructional engineering industry, examining the
   associated technical opportunities and challenges. The study compares
   the definitions, requirements and projects executed in this field. The
   technologies under examination are contrasted on the basis of their
   position within the data model. The preliminary findings suggest that
   some solutions for Industry 4.0 have already been developed for the
   construction engineering sector. However, it must be acknowledged that
   some solutions have yet to be fully validated.},

Abstract = {The construction industry is one of the world's largest industries, with
   an annual budget of \$10 trillion globally. Despite its size, the
   efficiency and growth in labour productivity in the construction
   industry have been relatively low compared to other sectors, such as
   manufacturing and agriculture. To this extent, many studies have
   recognised the role of automation in improving the efficiency and safety
   of construction projects. In particular, automated monitoring of
   construction sites is a significant research challenge. This paper
   provides a comprehensive review of recent research on the real-time
   monitoring of construction projects. The review focuses on sensor
   technologies and methodologies for real-time mapping, scene
   understanding, positioning, and tracking of construction activities in
   indoor and outdoor environments. The review also covers various case
   studies of applying these technologies and methodologies for real-time
   hazard identification, monitoring workers' behaviour, workers' health,
   and monitoring static and dynamic construction environments.},

Abstract = {Automated interior construction progress monitoring (ICPM) has gained
   increasing academic attention. This emerging research field faces
   numerous technical challenges that have been noted in previous studies
   but lack a holistic examination to analyze these challenges and their
   potential impacts. This study addresses this gap by conducting a
   systematic review of ICPM technical challenges, collecting related
   literature from Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases, and
   utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) framework for filtering and selecting literature.
   The filtration results in 44 strongly related technical papers.
   Alongside summarizing these challenges, the study explores their impacts
   on the entire ICPM automation process and proposes innovative solutions.
   Specifically, this study highlights the key phases of ICPM automation
   development, including data acquisition, 3D reconstruction, as-planned
   modeling, as-built modeling, progress comparison, and progress
   quantification, and subsequently identifies challenges for each phase,
   totaling 11 major challenges composed of 41 subchallenges. The data
   acquisition phase is found to have the most and most severe challenges,
   and challenges in other phases also impact the automation system
   performance. This review encompasses the identification of potential
   issues and proposes corresponding solutions, enabling future researchers
   to anticipate challenges and develop more advanced and user-friendly
   monitoring systems.},

Title = {Automated Optimization for the Production Scheduling of Prefabricated
   Elements Based on the Genetic Algorithm and IFC Object Segmentation},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: With the ever-increasing availability of data and a higher
   level of automation and simulation, production scheduling in the factory
   for prefabrication can no longer be seen as an autonomous solution.
   Concepts such as building information modelling (BIM), graphic
   techniques, databases, and interface development as well as heightened
   emphasis on overall-process optimization topics increase the pressure to
   connect to and interact with interrelated tasks and procedures. Methods:
   The automated optimization framework detailed in this study intended to
   generate optimal schedule of prefabricated component production based on
   the manufacturing process model and genetic algorithm method. An
   extraction and segmentation approach based on industry foundation
   classes (IFC) for prefabricated component production is discussed.
   During this process, the position and geometric information of the
   prefabricated components are adjusted and output in the extracted IFC
   file. Then, the production process and the completion time of each
   process have been examined and simulated with the genetic algorithm.
   Lastly, the automated optimization solution can be formed by the linking
   production scheduling database and the computational environment.
   Results: This shows that the implementation of the automated
   optimization framework for the production scheduling of the
   prefabricated elements improves the operability and accuracy of the
   production process. Conclusions: Based on the integration technique
   discussed above, the data transmission and integration in the mating
   application program is achieved by linking the Python-based application,
   the Structured Query Language (SQL) database and the computational
   environment. The implementation of the automated optimization framework
   model enables BIM models to play a better foundational role in patching
   up the technical gaps between prefabricated building designers and
   element producers.},

Title = {Construction and Maintenance of Building Geometric Digital Twins: State
   of the Art Review},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {9},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Most of the buildings that exist today were built based on 2D drawings.
   Building information models that represent design-stage product
   information have become prevalent in the second decade of the 21st
   century. Still, it will take many decades before such models become the
   norm for all existing buildings. In the meantime, the building industry
   lacks the tools to leverage the benefits of digital information
   management for construction, operation, and renovation. To this end,
   this paper reviews the state-of-the-art practice and research for
   constructing (generating) and maintaining (updating) geometric digital
   twins. This paper also highlights the key limitations preventing current
   research from being adopted in practice and derives a new geometry-based
   object class hierarchy that mainly focuses on the geometric properties
   of building objects, in contrast to widely used existing object
   categorisations that are mainly function-oriented. We argue that this
   new class hierarchy can serve as the main building block for
   prioritising the automation of the most frequently used object classes
   for geometric digital twin construction and maintenance. We also draw
   novel insights into the limitations of current methods and uncover
   further research directions to tackle these problems. Specifically, we
   believe that adapting deep learning methods can increase the robustness
   of object detection and segmentation of various types; involving design
   intents can achieve a high resolution of model construction and
   maintenance; using images as a complementary input can help to detect
   transparent and specular objects; and combining synthetic data for
   algorithm training can overcome the lack of real labelled datasets.},

Title = {Semantic framework for interdependent infrastructure resilience decision
   support},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {130},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The increasing need for interdependent infrastructure systems to
   withstand natural disasters has called for the cocreation of resilience
   decisions to minimize the impact on society. However, issues related to
   information integration across different infrastructure systems hamper
   decision making from a system-to-systems perspective. To resolve this
   problem, the Semantic Web technologies are presented in this paper to
   serve four functions: (i) linking cross domains through ontology
   development to represent different domain knowledge; (ii) integrating
   multiple-source heterogeneous data by a common data format; (iii)
   retrieving useful information using semantic query language; and (iv)
   deriving machine automatic logical reasoning by rule languages and logic
   engines to provide informed resilience decision making support. The
   proposed framework is tested by a case scenario involving intertwined
   drainage-transport-building systems under the influence of urban
   flooding. The result indicates that the framework effectively
   facilitates information integration between diverse infrastructure
   systems and helps decision-makers by providing resilience
   decision-making support.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {141},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building maintenance needs in public buildings depend on occupant
   activities and presence. Research should understand how different types
   of occupant density patterns can be used to forecast the likelihood of
   specific kinds of maintenance requests. This research adopts a
   data-driven approach to evaluate experimental-based correlations between
   maintenance work orders number (relating to a set of Italian university
   buildings as a relevant case study) and occupant density, thanks to
   exceptional conditions due to COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly
   altered building use. Results offer a power-law-based correlation model,
   confirming that the reduction of occupant density in the COVID-19
   lock-down phases impacted the number and perceived severity, but not the
   typologies, of maintenance work orders. The retrieved correlation model
   occupant could be directly used to define and prioritize maintenance
   strategies given occupant density. Future research could use the model
   to define outsourcing and contract definitions starting from historical
   data on maintenance actions.},

Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1090-1116},
Month = {NOV 21},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper critically analysed 195 articles with the objectives
   of providing a clear understanding of the current City Information
   Modelling (CIM) implementations, identifying the main challenges
   hampering the uptake of CIM and providing recommendations for the future
   development of CIM. Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts the
   PRISMA method in order to perform the systematic literature review.
   Findings The results identified nine domains of CIM implementation
   including (1) natural disaster management, (2) urban building energy
   modelling, (3) urban facility management, (4) urban infrastructure
   management, (5) land administration systems, (6) improvement of urban
   microclimates, (7) development of digital twin and smart cities, (8)
   improvement of social engagement and (9) urban landscaping design. 10;
   Further, eight challenges were identified that hinder the widespread
   employment of CIM including (1) reluctance towards CIM application, (2)
   data quality, (3) computing resources and storage inefficiency, (4) data
   integration between BIM and GIS and interoperability, (5) establishing a
   standardised workflow for CIM implementation, (6) synergy between all
   parties involved, (7) cybersecurity and intellectual property and (8)
   data management. Originality/value This is the first paper of its kind
   that provides a holistic understanding of the current implementation of
   CIM. The outcomes will benefit multiple target groups. First, urban
   planners and designers will be supplied with a status-quo understanding
   of CIM implementations. Second, this research introduces possibilities
   of CIM deployment for the governance of cities; hence the outcomes can
   be useful for policymakers. Lastly, the scientific community can use the
   findings of this study as a reference point to gain a comprehensive
   understanding of the field and contribute to the future development of
   CIM.},

Month = {2024 SEP 9},
Abstract = {To improving citizen's living quality and management efficiency, the
   construction of smart cities is critical on the agenda. Smart cities are
   highly dependent on multiple innovative technologies. City Information
   Modelling (CIM) is a promising approach that meets the implementation
   requirements of sustainable smart cities through various technology
   integrations. Therefore, this paper extracted 99 articles from the Web
   of Science core collection database from 2012 to 2022 for bibliometric
   analysis and investigated the research themes on the current development
   of CIM from theory, technology, and application perspectives. Based on
   the results of the holistic framework of each domain, existing problems
   and further development directions are proposed to govern the
   sustainable smart cities based on CIM. According to the findings, CIM,
   as a tool to aid decision-making for planning and managing sustainable
   smart cities, greatly promotes city development in the direction of
   intelligence and sustainability.},

Abstract = {Digital Twins (DT) implementation in the Built Environment (BE) industry
   is still in its early stages. Aiming to increase the knowledge about DT,
   this study analyzes how DT can be understood in the BE sector and
   investigates its different potential benefits and expected challenges.
   To do so, the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach was employed.
   Using 228 publications, the current study presents a proposed definition
   and structure for DT systems. The proposed structure is based on four
   main layers: physical, digital, application, and user layers. The study
   also classified the applications of DT into six groups: sustainability
   and environmental, facility management, safety, health, and risk
   management, structural performance, construction management, and
   architectural and urban-related applications. The challenges of DT
   implementation were also grouped based on industry-related, social and
   organizational, economic, technological, and political and legal
   challenges. Based on the results, future research directions and
   practical recommendations were presented to support the successful
   deployment of the technology.},

Title = {Technical specifications to meet the requirements of an Automatic Code
   Compliance Checking tool and current developments in infrastructure
   construction},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling has revolutionized the construction
   industry by, for example, contributing to the automation of different
   activities related to the design, planning, and construction of civil
   works. Tasks such as the review of construction-related codes and
   regulations, which today still require a great deal of human effort,
   have begun to be automated through the development of digital
   applications and tools, thus resulting in the BIM use case Automated
   Code Compliance Checking (ACCC). So far, however, the research and
   development around this topic have been focused mainly on the building
   area, leaving a gap for the infrastructure sector. With this article,
   the authors intend to contribute to closing this gap, by providing an
   overview of the current state of development of ACCC tools in
   infrastructure construction. This overview supports the identification
   of challenges and requirements for the development of such tools, which
   are also discussed in detail in the current work. Finally, the author's
   considerations regarding the formalization and structuring of the
   engineering knowledge and infrastructure data required for the
   development of ACCC tools, as well as its mapping in a graph database,
   which allows access to all the necessary and relevant information for
   the code checking process, are presented. The result of the research
   carried out is the detailed structuring of the regulations and their
   rules from infra-structure construction and the possible modeling
   implementation in a graph database. In practice, this should help the
   leading software manufacturers in cooperation with infrastructure
   engineers, to develop a full-fledged ACCC tool.},

   Information},
Journal = {SENSORS AND MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},

Pages = {415-425},
Abstract = {The size of the global construction market is expected to increase to
   about \$14 trillion by 2025, with fierce competition expected in
   emerging markets. However, construction is the only industrial sector
   whose productivity has declined over the past 50 years. Over the past
   two decades, the world economy has grown by 2.8\% and manufacturing
   productivity has grown by 3.6\% annually, but labor productivity growth
   in the construction sector has averaged less than 1\%. Recently,
   construction companies have made various attempts to increase
   productivity, for example, by implementing `smart construction' based on
   3D data at all stages such as investigation, measurement, design, and
   construction. Many construction sites are increasing the utilization of
   building information modeling (BIM), laser scanners, unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs), and automated construction equipment. However, studies
   on applying and analyzing 3D geospatial information in the construction
   process have been insufficient. In this study, an experiment on using 3D
   geospatial information technology in road construction was performed and
   analysis was conducted. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),
   static light detection and ranging (LiDAR), UAV LiDAR, and so forth were
   used to effectively build 3D geospatial information of the study area,
   and 3D designs were generated using the acquired data. The accuracy of
   data constructed through static LiDAR and UAV LiDAR was found to be
   within 0.025 m in the X, Y, and Z directions. A 3D design reflecting the
   actual terrain was created, and various sensors were installed on
   construction equipment to conduct experiments on construction
   automation. The productivity of construction automation was evaluated by
   comparing the results of traditional and automated construction
   processes. In the future, construction automation using 3D geospatial
   information technology will contribute to improving productivity not
   only for roads, but also at many other construction sites such as
   tunnels.},

Title = {Synthetic Datasets for Rebar Instance Segmentation Using Mask R-CNN},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The construction and inspection of reinforcement rebar currently rely
   entirely on manual work, which leads to problems such as high labor
   requirements and labor costs. Rebar image detection using deep learning
   algorithms can be employed in construction quality inspection and
   intelligent construction; it can check the number, spacing, and diameter
   of rebar on a construction site, and guide robots to complete rebar
   tying. However, the application of deep learning algorithms relies on a
   large number of datasets to train models, while manual data collection
   and annotation are time-consuming and laborious. In contrast, using
   synthetic datasets can achieve a high degree of automation of
   annotation. In this study, using rebar as an example, we proposed a mask
   annotation methodology based on BIM software and rendering software,
   which can establish a large and diverse training set for instance
   segmentation, without manual labeling. The Mask R-CNN trained using both
   real and synthetic datasets demonstrated a better performance than the
   models trained using only real datasets or synthetic datasets. This
   synthetic dataset generation method could be widely used for various
   image segmentation tasks and provides a reference for other computer
   vision engineering tasks and deep learning tasks in related fields.},

Abstract = {A fire protection system takes on a critical significance to building
   operation. This paper describes the use of digital twins (DTs) and
   semantic web technologies for the intelligent control of building fire
   protection (BFP) systems in fire accidents. Specifically, a data fusion
   stage and several information-based control mechanisms are involved in
   the use of the two technologies. A designed BFP ontology is considered
   as the semantic model and basis of data fusion between the static
   building geometric information and the dynamic sensing data. The above
   information is incorporated into a DT data model, which is considered as
   the mapping of physical space. Moreover, rule models and process models
   are developed to achieve intelligent control mechanisms and keep the DT
   data model synced with the physical space. A case study based on a fire
   accident simulation was conducted to verify the feasibility of the use
   of DTs and semantic web technologies.},

Title = {Performance Optimization of Building Envelope Through BIM and
   Multi-Criteria Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {In response to the growing demand for sustainable and performance-driven
   building design, this study proposes an integrated digital methodology
   that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM), parametric scripting,
   and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to optimize external wall
   assemblies. The approach leverages Autodesk Revit and Dynamo to automate
   the parametrization of insulation thickness while ensuring compliance
   with regulatory thresholds for thermal transmittance and surface mass.
   Acoustic performance is estimated using ECHO software, and a Weighted
   Sum Model (WSM) is applied to evaluate and rank configurations based on
   four criteria: economic cost, Global Warming Potential (GWP), embodied
   energy, and acoustic insulation. A case study involving 24 wall
   assemblies-generated from eight base stratigraphies and three insulation
   materials-demonstrates the method's ability to balance environmental
   impact, occupant comfort, and construction feasibility. The results
   indicate that natural and bio-based materials, such as rammed earth and
   cork, offer the best overall performance, while conventional systems
   remain competitive in terms of cost. The proposed workflow reduces
   design time, increases transparency, and supports informed
   decision-making during early design stages. This research contributes to
   the digitalization of sustainability assessment in architecture by
   promoting integrative, replicable, and regulation-aligned practices for
   low-impact building envelopes.},

Title = {COMPARISON OF 2D AND 3D WALL RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS FROM POINT CLOUD
   DATA FOR AS-BUILT BIM},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {173-192},
Abstract = {As-built Building Information Models (BIMs) are becoming increasingly
   popular in the Architectural, Engineering, Construction, Owner and
   Operator (AECOO) industry. These models reflect the state of the
   building up to as-built conditions. The production of these models for
   existing buildings with no prior BIM includes the segmentation and
   classification of point cloud data and the reconstruction of the BIM
   objects. The automation of this process is a must since the manual
   Scan-to-BIM procedure is both time-consuming and error prone. However,
   the automated reconstruction from point cloud data is still ongoing
   research with both 2D and 3D approaches being proposed. There currently
   is a gap in the literature concerning the quality assessment of the
   created entities.
   In this research, we present the empirical comparison of both strategies
   with respect to existing specifications. A 3D and a 2D reconstruction
   method are implemented and tested on a real life test case. The
   experiments focus on the reconstruction of the wall geometry from
   unstructured point clouds as it forms the basis of the model. Both
   presented approaches are unsupervised methods that segment, classify and
   create generic wall elements. The first method operates on the 3D point
   cloud itself and consists of a general approach for the segmentation and
   classification and a class-specific reconstruction algorithm for the
   wall geometry. The point cloud is first segmented into planar clusters,
   after which a Random Forests classifier is used with geometric and
   contextual features for the semantic labelling. The final wall geometry
   is created based on the 3D point clusters representing the walls. The
   second method is an efficient Manhattan-world scene reconstruction
   algorithm that simultaneously segments and classifies the point cloud
   based on point feature histograms. The wall reconstruction is considered
   an instance of image segmentation by representing the data as 2D raster
   images. Both methods have promising results towards the reconstruction
   of wall geometry of multi-story buildings. The experiments report that
   over 80\% of the walls were correctly segmented by both methods.
   Furthermore, the reconstructed geometry is conform Level-of-Accuracy 20
   for 88\% of the data by the first method and for 55\% by the second
   method despite the Manhattan-world scene assumption. The empirical
   comparison showcases the fundamental differences in both strategies and
   will support the further development of these methods.},

Title = {Semiautomated Railway Line Information Modeling Based on Asset
   Management Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The operation and maintenance (O\&M) period is a critical and
   resource-intensive phase of the life cycle of railway line
   infrastructure. The O\&M of a railway line during this period requires a
   large amount of investment and labor. Thus, there is an urgent need for
   railway managers to seek more efficient management tools and methods to
   improve management efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.
   Infrastructure-building information model (I-BIM) technology,
   characterized by its intuitive representation and high
   information-integration capabilities, has gained considerable traction
   with infrastructure industry researchers. In the context of existing
   railway lines, the absence of corresponding I-BIMs or similar technology
   owing to the immaturity of technical development at the time led to the
   use of manual modeling processes, which have limitations such as high
   cost, slow speed, and low efficiency. This paper presents an innovative,
   high-speed, semiautomated method for generating I-BIMs for existing
   railway lines and leveraging asset management data without incurring
   additional data collection costs. This approach leverages key modules
   such as line trajectory computation, element model generation, the
   linking of O\&M semantic information, and the visualization of asset
   health indexes, which can enable the swift and semiautomated creation of
   an O\&M-oriented I-BIM for railway lines. This process elevates
   traditional two-dimensional database tables into more intuitive,
   operation-oriented, and semantically rich models. This results in the
   provision of more efficient support for maintenance management decisions
   related to railway lines. The proposed method addresses the limitations
   of manual modeling processes and can pave the way for enhanced O\&M
   efficiency in the railway infrastructure sector.
   The absence of BIMs during the design and construction phase of existing
   railway lines, coupled with the high costs and error rates associated
   with manual modeling, constitute substantial barriers to the
   implementation of BIMs in operation and management. By leveraging the
   proposed semiautomated modeling approach, which relies on management
   data, site managers and researchers can rapidly establish basic I-BIMs.
   Although the asset ledgers and station equipment plans used in this
   approach originate from National Railway Administration, similar data
   sets should serve as fundamental inputs for railway line operation and
   maintenance worldwide. By deploying this method, field managers can
   enhance traditional two-dimensional (2D) asset ledgers into a
   three-dimensional (3D) I-BIM, thereby offering a more intuitive
   understanding of the assets within their jurisdiction. Owing to the
   integration of geographic information system maps into the model,
   personnel can directly query asset-related geographic information,
   potentially reducing the frequency and cost of off-site surveys. For
   researchers, using this method to establish a real-world model rapidly
   offers convenient access for further BIM-based applications, such as the
   integration of real-time data from on-site sensors to formulate digital
   twins.},

Title = {Human Resource Management Digitalisation in Multidisciplinary Ship
   Design Companies},
Journal = {POLISH MARITIME RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {120-128},

Abstract = {The digitalisation in the ship design sector is currently applied to the
   design process itself and is well defined, partially standardised and
   practically implemented by both independent design companies and the
   design departments of shipyards. The situation is similar in other
   sectors of engineering. However, the requirements for the digitalisation
   of other processes in design and engineering companies have not
   previously been studied, and the limited financial resources of ship
   design companies mean that there is a need for research on the
   digitalisation needs of multidisciplinary ship design companies. The
   implementation of building information modelling (BIM) solutions is
   costly for design companies and generates benefits mainly for shipyards
   and shipowners. The lack of benefits for design companies leads to the
   hesitation of managers whenever digitalisation is considered; the scope
   and scale of the digitalisation, as well as the selected software and
   BIM level, are defined by the shipyard requirements. The participation
   and support of management in the digitalisation process is one of the
   key success factors; the expected benefits caused by digitalisation for
   the organisation will increase the motivation of managers to invest
   limited resources in digitalisation. There are no data that indicate the
   processes with a high potential for digitalisation and the scale of
   expected improvements in ship design companies; therefore, research in
   this area was performed with a group of project managers from design and
   engineering companies. The research focused on collecting the opinions
   and experiences of the managers related to the manual management of
   resources and comparing the poll results with the conclusions from the
   enterprise resource planning (ERP) system data analyses. The paper
   analyses if the digital automation of the resource management process
   can lead to the substantial improvement of the operations of
   multi-project, multidisciplinary engineering ship design companies.},

   Automatization Maturity in Steel Construction},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Construction 4.0 is propelling the construction sector towards a
   digital, automated, and sustainable framework. This paper reviews
   advancements in automation and digitalization within the steel
   construction industry, framed by the principles of Construction 4.0. An
   analysis of the existing literature indicates that previous review
   studies have explored the technologies and concepts associated with
   Construction 4.0. However, none have consolidated these technologies and
   concepts (T\&C) specifically within the context of the steel
   construction industry to evaluate their impact on steel manufacturing
   and assembly processes which was the main criterion for article
   selection. Therefore, this paper aims to consolidate various
   Construction 4.0 technologies and concepts to explore their integration
   into the steel construction industry. Based on data from the Web of
   Science and Scopus, a thorough screening process identified 56 out of
   161 articles for analysis regarding their applicability to the steel
   construction industry. The evolution of various technologies in the
   steel construction industry has been examined over the years, starting
   with the initial references to each technology. In addition to
   discussing the advancements of these technologies and their influence on
   contemporary digitalization and automation within the steel sector, the
   authors seek to identify which T\&C are most commonly utilized in
   manufacturing and assembly processes. The graphical results of this
   review indicate that each type of T\&C can serve as a tool for quality
   control throughout the manufacturing and assembly processes. However, it
   is noteworthy that most research remains concentrated on enhancing
   material tracking and identification during these stages of production.},

Title = {An ontology-based innovative energy modeling framework for scalable and
   adaptable building digital twins},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {292},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Digitalization of buildings and the use of IoT sensing and metering
   devices are steadily increasing, offering new opportunities for more
   autonomous, efficient, and flexible buildings. As part of this
   transformation and inspired by the added value demonstrated in other
   domains, the concept of a building digital twin that can monitor,
   simulate, manage, and optimize building operation has received increased
   interest. To aid such digital twin implementations, accurate and
   adaptable simulation models are required, which can effectively
   integrate and utilize the available data. However, traditional building
   modeling and digital practices, such as Building Information Modeling
   and white-box modeling tools, are not easily compatible with these
   requirements. This work presents an innovative and flexible energy
   modeling framework based on the SAREF ontology. With a basis in the
   SAREF4BLDG extension for buildings and the defined classes, different
   models are presented for a selection of typical systems and devices such
   as spaces, space heaters, dampers, coils, etc. Using the generic
   semantics and relations of the SAREF4SYST extension, a method for
   linking and simulating component models is then presented. A
   proof-of-concept of the modeling framework is provided, showing its
   application and feasibility to provide a dynamic simulation of the
   different systems and devices included in a demonstration case. Finally,
   a future line of work is identified considering the implementation of
   the modeling framework in an actual building case study, including
   integration with actual sensing equipment to demonstrate different
   digital twin services such as performance monitoring, strategy planning,
   and operational optimization.},

Title = {Digital approaches to construction compliance checking: Validating the
   suitability of an ecosystem approach to compliance checking},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {59},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The lifecycle of the built environment is governed by complex
   regulations, requirements and standards. Ensuring compliance against
   these requirements is a complicated process, affecting the entire supply
   chain and often incurring significant costs, delay and uncertainty. Many
   of the processes, and elements within these processes, are formalised
   and supported by varying levels of digitisation and automation. This
   ranges from energy simulation, geometric checking, to building
   information modelling based checking. However, there are currently no
   unifying standards or integrating technology to tie regulatory efforts
   together to enable the widespread adoption of automated compliance
   processes. This has left many current technical approaches, while
   advanced and robust, isolated. However, the increasing maturity of asset
   datasets/information models, means that integration of data/tools is now
   feasible. This paper will propose and validate a new approach of solving
   the problem of automated compliance checking through the use of an
   ecosystem of compliance checking services. This work has identified a
   clear research gap. How automated compliance checking in the
   construction sector can move beyond sole reliance on BIM data, and
   tightly coupled integration with software tools, to provide an
   extensible enough system to integrate the current isolated software
   elements currently used within compliance checking processes. To test
   this approach, an architecture for an ecosystem of compliance services
   will be specified. To validate this architecture, a prototype version
   will be developed and validated against requirements derived from the
   weaknesses of current approaches. This validation has found that a
   distributed ecosystem can perform accurately and successfully, whilst
   providing advantages in terms of scalability and extensibility. This
   approach provides a route to the increased adoption of automated
   compliance checking, overcoming the issues of relying on one computer
   system/application to perform all aspects of this process.},

Title = {Digital Twin Framework for Enabling Serial Construction},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Modularized construction with precast concrete elements has many
   advantages, such as shorter construction times, higher quality,
   flexibility, and lower costs. These advantages are mainly due to its
   potential for prefabrication and series production. However, the
   production processes are still craftsmanship, and automation rarely
   occurs. Fundamental to the automation of production is digitization. In
   recent years, the manufacturing industry made significant progress
   through the intelligent networking of components, machines, and
   processes in the introduction of Industry 4.0. A key concept of Industry
   4.0 is the digital twin, which represents both components and machines,
   thus creating a dynamic network in which the participants can
   communicate with each other. So far, BIM and digital twins in
   construction have focused mainly on the structure as a whole and do not
   consider feedback loops from production at the component level. This
   paper proposes a framework for a digital twin for the industrialized
   production of precast concrete elements in series production based on
   the asset administration shell (AAS) from the context of Industry 4.0.
   For this purpose, relevant production processes are identified, and
   their information requirements are derived. Data models and
   corresponding AAS for precast concrete parts will be created for the
   identified processes. The functionalities of the presented digital twin
   are demonstrated using the use case of quality control for a precast
   concrete wall element. The result shows how data can be exchanged with
   the digital twin and used for decision-making.},

Title = {A review on HBIM modelling process from 3D point clouds by applying

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLYTECHNIC-POLITEKNIK DERGISI},

Abstract = {In the context of Cultural Heritage (CH), the widespread adoption of 3D
   point cloud technology, coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   algorithms, plays a pivotal role. These technologies facilitate the
   creation of as-built models by integrating Building Information
   Modelling (BIM) strategies, enhancing collaboration within the
   Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector. Leveraging
   computer vision, robotics, and remote sensing, 3D point clouds provide
   rich data. However, manual segmentation and classification are
   labor-intensive and error prone. Consequently, researchers increasingly
   turn to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for
   automating these tasks. The transition from manual reconstruction to
   automated procedures is crucial. Despite progress, gaps remain,
   particularly in incorporating 3D point cloud segmentation into
   Historical Building Information Modelling (HBIM). The lack of conclusive
   evidence regarding automated derivation of parametric attributes from
   segmentation outcomes underscores the need for further exploration.
   Addressing this gap is essential for cultural asset documentation,
   conservation, and upkeep. By automating the segmentation and
   classification of 3D point clouds, efficient communication via a shared
   database becomes feasible. The article aims to review studies on
   semantically parsing and classifying 3D point clouds using AI
   algorithms, particularly within complex cultural heritage geometries,
   shedding light on potential benefits and barriers.},

Title = {A BIM-Based Bar Bending Schedule Generation Algorithm with Enhanced
   Accuracy},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Rebar quantity estimation is pivotal for determining the cost of
   construction projects and is essential for bidding purposes. A bar
   bending schedule plays a crucial role by providing rebar information and
   bending instructions, facilitating efficient procurement. Traditional
   methods, which rely on manually extracting data from 2D
   (two-dimensional) drawings, are error-prone and hinder construction
   productivity. This study utilized a special length approach to yield
   optimal rebar consumption, resulting in a total rebar order of
   19,582.427 t and minimizing rebar waste to 0.77\%. Additionally, this
   method saved 3000.22 t of rebar compared to traditional methods, using
   only stock lengths. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency, a 3D
   (three-dimensional) model was developed in a Building Information
   Modeling (BIM) environment to prepare a Bar Bending Schedule (BBS)
   automatically, integrated with an Application Programming Interface
   (API) for data entry to eliminate manual errors. The efficacy of the
   proposed algorithm was confirmed by comparing the rebar quantities it
   generated with those obtained from optimization calculations. The
   results demonstrated a mean absolute error of 0.017 and a mean absolute
   percentage error of 1.13\%, validating the algorithm's precision.
   Furthermore, this method reduced the manpower required for BBS
   preparation by 33.33\%, highlighting its potential to revolutionize
   construction workflow efficiency and accuracy.},

Title = {A semantics-driven framework to enable demand flexibility control
   applications in real buildings},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {64},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Decarbonising and digitalising the energy sector requires scalable and
   interoperable Demand Flexibility (DF) applications. Semantic models are
   promising technologies for achieving these goals, but existing studies
   focused on DF applications exhibit limitations. These include dependence
   on bespoke ontologies, lack of computational methods to generate
   semantic models, ineffective temporal data management and absence of
   platforms that use these models to easily develop, configure and deploy
   controls in real buildings. This paper introduces a semantics-driven
   framework to enable DF control applications in real buildings. The
   framework supports the generation of semantic models that adhere to
   Brick and SAREF while using metadata from Building Information Models
   (BIM) and Building Automation Systems (BAS). The work also introduces a
   web platform that leverages these models and an actor and microservices
   architecture to streamline the development, configuration and deployment
   of DF controls. The paper demonstrates the framework through a case
   study, illustrating its ability to integrate diverse data sources,
   execute DF actuation in areal building, and promote modularity for easy
   reuse, extension, and customisation of applications. The paper also
   discusses the alignment between Brick and SAREF, the value of leveraging
   BIM data sources, and the framework's benefits over existing approaches,
   demonstrating a 75\% reduction in effort for developing, configuring,
   and deploying building controls.},

   Concrete Structures},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the context of Industry 4.0, construction processes are shifting
   towards automation by implementing additive manufacturing (AM) of
   concrete structures, also referred to as concrete printing. Adapting
   concrete as a printing material entails complex material-process
   interactions between concrete and manufacturing processes that require
   specialized data modeling. However, data modeling for the AM of concrete
   structures has not kept up with concrete printing research and
   development. Aiming to enhance data modeling for the AM of concrete
   structures, this paper proposes a semantic modeling approach, referred
   to as ``printing information modeling{''} (PIM). The PIM approach
   defines input parameters and material-process interaction in a generic
   printing information model for designing and planning concrete printing
   projects. Exchange requirements for concrete printing are identified and
   evaluated, serving as the basis for the printing information model. The
   printing information model, as a semantic (or meta) model, is
   conceptualized using object-oriented modeling concepts, formalized as an
   ontology, verified as an instantiable semantic model, and validated with
   a software tool developed as a plug-in for BIM platforms. As a result, a
   printing information model is developed to serve as a generally valid
   semantic model for the AM of concrete structures and has the potential
   to improve data modeling concepts currently deployed for concrete
   printing.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence exploitation in facility management using deep
   learning},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {609-624},
Month = {AUG 22},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to apply a methodology that is capable to classify and
   localize mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) elements to assist
   facility managers. Furthermore, it assists in decreasing the technical
   complexity and sophistication of different systems to the facility
   management (FM) team.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This research exploits artificial intelligence (AI) in FM operations
   through proposing a new system that uses a deep learning pre-trained
   model for transfer learning. The model can identify new MEP elements
   through image classification with a deep convolutional neural network
   using a support vector machine (SVM) technique under supervised
   learning. Also, an expert system is developed and integrated with an
   Android application to the proposed system to identify the required
   maintenance for the identified elements. FM team can reach the
   identified assets with bluetooth tracker devices to perform the required
   maintenance.
   Findings
   The proposed system aids facility managers in their tasks and decreases
   the maintenance costs of facilities by maintaining, upgrading, operating
   assets cost-effectively using the proposed system.
   Research limitations/implications
   The paper considers three fire protection systems for proactive
   maintenance, where other structural or architectural systems can also
   significantly affect the level of service and cost expensive repairs and
   maintenance. Also, the proposed system relies on different platforms
   that required to be consolidated for facility technicians and managers
   end-users. Therefore, the authors will consider these limitations and
   expand the study as a case study in future work.
   Originality/value
   This paper assists in a proactive manner to decrease the lack of
   knowledge of the required maintenance to MEP elements that leads to a
   lower life cycle cost. These MEP elements have a big share in the
   operation and maintenance costs of building facilities.},

Abstract = {Purpose The emergence of new digital technologies in the era of the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution presents a turning point that could change
   the fate of the traditional ways of designing, build and manage asset
   data. Disruptive technologies such as Blockchain and theInternet of
   things (IoT) are one of the main pillars that are driving this
   revolution. The integration of decentralised networks and automated
   workflows has the potential to become a pivotal factor in construction
   projects, especially in supply chain ecosystems within the off-site
   manufacturing field. Obstacles related to fragmented information,
   interoperability, transparency and ``big data{''} management are the
   main drivers for change that the industry needs to address. Whilst
   organisations and users can automate workflows and processes by
   utilising IoT technology to transfer data without human-to-human or
   human-to-computer interaction, the interaction, storage and management
   of the data generated are not safe or reliable.
   Design/methodology/approach The approach outlined in this paper
   addresses the challenges that IoT and centralised networks present.
   Blockchain, a peer-to-peer distributed database, offers the possibility
   to support and maintain the asset information without interruptions in
   all the stages of the life cycle. The synergy between these
   technologies, along with other techniques, methods and platforms (such
   as building information modeling (BIM)), based on a single environment,
   will support information traceability from the strategic definition to
   end of life. Findings The framework of this study presents an excellent
   opportunity to apply new workflows and processes with the application of
   new technologies and protocols. It benefits from a well-established
   platform such as BIM to enable the coordination and management of
   digital assets as well as giving illustration and collaboration to the
   supply chain members. IoT and Blockchain are the other layers that work
   together with the third layer (BIM). This framework proposed the use of
   these platforms to ensure the information traceability of physical and
   digital assets, data automation and information management, in a dynamic
   supply chain ecosystem, bringing efficiency and transparency to
   stakeholders and users. Practical implications This study provides an
   exploratory framework to be used by the supply chain members in offsite
   manufacturing, and the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC)
   industry in general, to track asset information throughout their entire
   life cycle securely and transparently. Originality/value This paper
   contributes to the knowledge of IoT, Blockchain technology and BIM use
   in offsite manufacturing under the AEC industry. It provides a basis for
   future research by professionals, experts and academics regarding these
   technologies and their workflows.},

Abstract = {PurposeConstruction safety is heavily affected by using new technologies
   in this growing trend of technology adoption. Especially, safety
   performance is enhanced through the utilization of some effective
   technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, BIM and
   wearable devices. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to
   investigate the influence of emerging technologies on construction
   safety performance and quantify the relationship between those. The
   proposed components of emerging technologies are BIM, GIS, VR, RFID, AI,
   ML, eye tracking and serious games and wearable devices, whereas the
   dimensions of construction safety performance are safety planning,
   safety training, safety inspection and monitoring, safety audits and
   reviews and safety leadership.Design/methodology/approachA structural
   model was composed consisting of emerging technologies and safety
   performance indicators. Then, a questionnaire was designed and
   administered to construction professionals, and data from 167 projects
   were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The data were analyzed
   by using software, called SPSS AMOS.FindingsThe analysis of the
   structural model proves that there is a positive and significant
   relationship between emerging technologies and construction safety
   performance. Moreover, the factor loadings for each factor were found to
   be high indicating a good representation of the construct by the
   components developed. Among the technologies, BIM, robotics and
   automation, AI and wearable devices were detected to be the most
   significant technologies in terms of impacting safety
   performance.Originality/valueThe study contributes to the body of
   knowledge in that it develops a conceptual framework consisting of
   specific technologies in terms of emerging technologies, reveals the
   impact of such technologies on safety performance and proposes several
   tools and strategies for enabling effective safety management along the
   project lifecycle. Industry practitioners may benefit from the framework
   developed by adopting such technologies to enhance their safety
   performance on construction projects.},

Title = {Indoor navigation supported by the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC): A
   survey},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {121},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) represents a new technology which
   supports the creation and management of a construction project for
   buildings. The most well-known open BIM standard, the Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC), provides the detailed 3D geometry and rich
   spatial semantics. It has drawn growing attention of researchers working
   in geographical information science (GIS). In many related applications,
   indoor navigation greatly benefits from IFC since it requires the
   information about building interiors. IFC provides the semantics and
   geometry of building, and topological relationships of building elements
   can be readily derived. These three types of information are extensively
   used in the research on indoor navigation. In this paper we review the
   current approaches, applications and solutions developed for different
   aspects of indoor navigation, and summarize the latest status about the
   use of IFC-based BIM for indoor navigation. In the literature regarding
   both IFC and indoor navigation, a total of 87 related papers are
   identified and categorized. 30 papers relate to the generation of indoor
   navigation models; 20 papers are about model conversion and data
   modeling on the basis of the IFC schema; 13 papers refer to IFC
   applications with dynamic environments; 14 papers focus on the support
   of IFC to indoor localization; and the other papers involve various
   topics such as visualization and network queries based on IFC. We find
   that the most active research direction is to generate navigation models
   from IFC data, yet there is no robust automation method of the
   generation. By discussing the pros and cons of the current applications,
   this paper suggests three new directions for further research on the IFC
   supports to indoor navigation. That is, researchers can further
   investigate the vertical dimension of the 3D geometry in IFC, facilitate
   the transformation from IFC to standardized indoor navigation models and
   manage real-time data with IFC to reflect indoor changes.},

Abstract = {PurposeIn the construction industry, various parties are involved in a
   project. Consequently, claims and disputes are inevitable in this
   industry. This paper aims to develop Integrated project delivery (IPD)
   practices including early involvement of stakeholders and multiparty
   contracts which its combination with advanced technologies such as
   blockchain can lead to better dispute management and improve the whole
   construction process.Design/methodology/approachBased on literature
   review, the alternative dispute resolution (ADR) for IPD contacts were
   identified, and three formats of IPD contracts were selected, and the
   dispute resolution process of them has been analyzed. Then, based on
   blockchain review, a conceptual blockchain-based dispute management
   (BDM) model was generated for ADR in IPD. Model validation was done by
   an interview. Experts were asked to compare the BDM model with the
   traditional system regarding the ADR duration.FindingsAnalyses of the
   collected data from the experts demonstrated that the BDM model has
   better function in terms of time and cost for ADR process when the
   project is facing serious and considerable number of disputes. The
   relation between blockchain technology (BCT) and building information
   modeling (BIM) has been examined through a framework, and the ability of
   the proposed model for administrating dispute resolution process has
   been verified using four different scenarios of construction claims that
   show the system can run successfully.OriginalityThe current study
   proposes a truthful model, reliable framework to address the problem of
   project dispute management in IPD contracts. The system combines the
   ability to being unchangeable and the reliability characteristics of BCT
   with informative and automation aspects of BIM together to improve
   dispute resolution issue in the IPD system.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to examine and discuss the current
   patterns, gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the architectural,
   engineering, construction, operation, and facility management (AECO-FM)
   industry and to propose future directions for industry stakeholders. A
   bibliometric search was performed on 197 papers that were obtained from
   the Scopus database. 151 of those papers were used in the subsequent
   scientometric analysis and mapping to narrate the evolution of the
   research subject. The studies discussed in the paper cover a wide range
   of research from model-based information management to building
   information management, all the way to the interaction between buildings
   and smart cities. The `virtual-physical building integration', `building
   lifecycle management', and `information integrated production' subjects
   are highly in the focus of the research field. While `information-based
   predictive management' and `virtual-based information utilization'
   studies need to be addressed for a holistic Digital Twin adoption in the
   AECO-FM industry. Future studies should focus on the full integration of
   digital twin and its physical counterpart for better performance
   throughout the building life cycle. This study highlights the patterns,
   gaps and trends in Digital Twin research in the AECO-FM industry and
   contributes to the state-of-the-art digitalization and automation
   approaches in the construction project management body of knowledge. The
   sample size is a limitation for this research since it is relatively
   small due to the newness of the subject. Future studies may include data
   related to practice-oriented innovations and industry-initiated
   improvements to achieve broader and more informed results.},

Volume = {63},

Pages = {29-42},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This research proposes a parametric design process model to improve the
   structural engineering project team performance by automating the design
   and three-dimensional modelling procedures of box culverts. Although
   standardised design procedures can reduce the design time of repetitive
   structures such as box culverts, the increased time and effort required
   for revising construction drawings negatively impacts a project's
   performance. A literature review was conducted to develop a theoretical
   process model to improve the current structural design optimisation and
   three-dimensional modelling procedures of box culverts. The proposed
   process model was validated using structured interviews with
   professionally registered structural engineers for appropriateness to
   box culverts and the potential to improve project performance. The data
   analysis revealed that the interviewed engineers were in favour of
   automating the design optimisation and three-dimensional modelling
   procedures of box culverts. Moreover, parametric design automation would
   result in improved project performance when encountering an inevitable
   design change. However, the user's control over the output of each
   process should not be discarded. This study can help readers understand
   the transformation of the structural design and three-dimensional
   modelling procedures of repetitive structures, such as box culverts,
   into an algorithmic form to achieve improved project performance.},

Abstract = {The advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has spurred the
   development of innovative products, significantly impacting industries
   reliant on technology -oriented machinery and equipment, notably the
   construction sector. In response, the Ministry of Works, through CIDB
   Malaysia, has implemented the Construction Strategy Plan 4.0 (2021 -
   -2025), grounded in 4IR principles, to facilitate the construction
   industry's gradual adaptation to technological advancements. Despite its
   introduction in 2016 to enhance project delivery efficiency and
   effectiveness, the extent of adoption of advanced 4IR-related
   technologies and the industry players' awareness of the importance of
   the Construction 4.0 strategic plan remains largely unexplored.
   Therefore, this paper examines the awareness and adoption level of CR
   4.0 technologies in the Malaysian construction industry through a
   structured questionnaire survey with all G1 -G7 contractors that
   registered with CIDB Malaysia. Based on 912 valid questionnaire
   responses received from these contractor grades, it has been identified
   that the awareness and adoption of most of the contractors in Malaysia
   on construction 4.0 technologies are predominantly at a semi -automation
   level. Most of the contractors in Malaysia especially lower grade

Title = {INTERPRETED OPEN DATA EXCHANGE BETWEEN ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN AND
   STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS MODELS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {39-57},
Abstract = {The heterogeneity of the architecture, engineering and construction
   (AEC) industry reflects on digital building models, which differ across
   domains and planning phases. Data exchange between architectural design
   and structural analysis models poses a particular challenge because of
   dramatically different representations of building elements. Existing
   software tools and standards have not been able to deal with these
   differences. The research on inter-domain building information modelling
   (BIM) frameworks does not consider the geometry interpretations for data
   exchange. Analysis of geometry interpretations is mostly
   project-specific and is seldom reflected in general data exchange
   frameworks. By defining a data exchange framework that engages with
   varying requirements and representations of architectural design and
   structural analysis in terms of geometry, which is open to other
   domains, we aim to close the identified gap. Existing classification
   systems in software tools and standards were reviewed in order to
   understand architectural design and structural analysis representations
   and to identify the relationships between them. Following the analysis,
   a novel data management framework based on classification,
   interpretation and automation was proposed, implemented and tested.
   Classification is a model specification including domain-specific terms
   and relationships between them. Interpretations consist of inter-domain
   procedures necessary to generate domain-specific models from a provided
   model. Automation represents the connection between open domain-specific
   models and proprietary models in software tools. Practical
   implementation with a test case demonstrated a possible realization of
   the proposed framework. The innovative contribution of the research is a
   novel framework based on the system of open domain-specific
   classifications and procedures for the inter-domain interpretation,
   which can prepare domain-specific models on central storage. The main
   benefit is a centrally prepared domain-specific model, relieving
   software developers from so-far-unsuccessful implementation of complex
   inter-domain interpretations in each software tool, and providing end
   users with control over the data exchange. Although the framework is
   based on the exchange between architectural design and structural
   analysis, the proposed central data management framework can be used for
   other exchange processes involving different model representations.},

Title = {Vision-Based Framework for Automatic Progress Monitoring of Precast
   Walls by Using Surveillance Videos during the Construction Phase},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Detecting and locating precast components to confirm and update
   components' status information is the key to construction progress
   monitoring. There are several ways to collect the information of
   elements in construction sites, such as manual collection, laser
   scanning, and tag-based methods. But each of these methods has its own
   limitations. Considering that effective and accurate construction
   progress monitoring is fundamental to construction management, this
   paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the latest computer
   vision methods to realize automatically monitoring construction progress
   of precast walls, one of the essential components in precast
   construction. In this framework, object detection, instance
   segmentation, and multiple-object tracking are combined to collect
   precast walls' location and temporal information from the surveillance
   videos recording the construction phase. Status information identified
   and collected is stored as a JavaScript object notation (JSON) format
   and then sent into a corresponding building information model (BIM) to
   timestamp the wall components. Each method in the framework is
   evaluated, respectively, and the demonstration on a real project proves
   the feasibility, convenience, and efficiency of this vision-based
   framework. The research results prove the proposed framework's ability
   to monitor the construction progress of precast walls automatically.
   Furthermore, the vital information extracted by the proposed framework
   contributes to serving application scenarios of the cyber-physical
   system in construction sites.},

Abstract = {The uniqueness and inherent complexities of the construction industry
   require the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve its processes
   and enhance overall competitiveness and performance. This study examined
   the awareness level and application of AI to provide useful insights
   into the state of AI applications in the Nigerian construction industry.
   A quantitative research design with the use of a questionnaire was used
   to obtain data from 53 construction professionals in the Lagos Island
   area of Lagos State, Nigeria. The professionals included Quantity
   Surveyors, Architects, Civil Engineers, Builders, and Estate Surveyors
   selected based on a purposive sampling technique. Data from the survey
   were analyzed with frequencies, mean, and ANOVA. The study found that
   most of the respondents were aware of the application of AI in
   construction, and there was no difference in the awareness level of the
   participants irrespective of their professional affiliations,
   organizational type, and organizational size. Generally, the most common
   application of AI among the participants surveyed were generative
   designs in BIM, measurement and estimating software, and the use of
   sensors in intelligent buildings. Moreover, design and project planning
   was found to be the most critical areas of need for AI in the study
   area. The study underscores the need for investments in other AI
   applications other than BIM and estimating software to improve
   productivity, performance, and enhance client satisfaction. (C) 2022 The

Abstract = {The design processes based on parametric design and generative design

   The aim of the developed program was to automate the urban design
   concept development process for selected land units with a local
   development plan. This document, ordinances and other sources were the
   guidelines for the program to be developed. The solution-generating
   program starts by taking in the data, and then geometrical objects are
   created that have the right relationships to each other. Finally,
   results are evaluated on the basis of calculated indices and further
   generations are created taking into account the best options. This
   process must be overseen by a human, but with the development of machine
   learning and artificial intelligence, automation will progress, reducing
   human effort. The results of the study were collated and compared with

Title = {Web-Based Architecture for Automating Quantity Surveying Construction
   Cost Calculation},
Journal = {INFRASTRUCTURES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Quantity Surveying (QS) is a process concerned with controlling and
   managing the costs of construction projects. QS Measurement relies on
   sophisticated measurement rules that are understood by experienced
   practitioners. Traditional QS systems, such as standard paperwork, are
   time-consuming and only approximate the cost estimate. This paper aims
   to design and deploy a web-based framework for automating the cost
   estimation of concrete construction, using ASP.NET. It introduces a
   user-friendly interface, which ensures that the work is completed in the
   chronological order of the construction phases. The proposed QS
   framework offers a reliable and time-efficient estimation method, in
   comparison to other methods (i.e., human labor using paper or Excel),
   which was tested using real data and was validated by experts and
   consultant companies. Furthermore, it automated the reading of project
   information from construction maps, which reduced errors when estimating
   costs. It could also automatically determine the project location using
   Google Maps and could quickly guide the user to the location. The
   proposed QS framework automated the manual and Excel work of cost
   computing with an accuracy of 99\%, reducing human calculation errors.
   It also effectively reduced the calculation time to only three days
   (compared to 114 days of manual work or 19 days of Excel work). The
   comparison result of the Quantity Surveyor's average paid salary
   indicated that using web-based QS framework helps in reducing the cost
   estimation time and labor costs.},

Abstract = {This bibliographic study presents a historical perspective on Korea's
   construction engineering and management (CEM) research and reports a
   27-year analysis of papers written by Korean CEM researchers between
   1993 and 2019. Frequency analysis of the collected papers was performed
   according to three main perspectives: the knowledge area, research
   topics, and methods. Knowledge area analysis shows that research fields
   have become more diversified and subdivided. Construction technology,
   cost management, and planning and schedule management have consistently
   maintained the top three positions for the past three decades. In
   addition, quality management, resource management, and risk management
   were also ranked high in the 2000s. In the 2010s, safety management,
   environmental management, quality management, and construction industry
   and business were ranked high. These changes reveal how Korean society's
   and industry's demands have changed over the years. Furthermore, the
   findings from keyword frequency analysis revealed that the focus of CEM
   research was mostly on cost and scheduling in the 1990s and on
   scheduling, risk, cost, and construction automation in the 2000s. The
   advent of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the 2010s was an
   epochal change. This study found that the research methods frequently
   used by CEM researchers were simulation, optimization, regression
   analysis, computer vision and image processing, 3D modeling, case-based
   reasoning, genetic algorithm, case study, economic analysis, and
   artificial neural network.},

Abstract = {Contract management, which directly impacts the success of architecture,
   engineering, and construction (AEC) projects, has been affected by the
   application of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies. This study extensively
   reviewed the I4.0 application in contract management using a hybrid
   approach of bibliometrics and a systematic literature review to capture
   this trend. Scopus and Web of Science were selected as the papers'
   databases, and 203 papers were filtered from a total of 2,524 papers
   from 2011 until the end of 2022. The bibliometric analysis explored and
   analyzed large volumes of data in six areas: publication year, journal,
   country, author, methodology, and keyword. The systematic literature
   review discovered eight key topics regarding I4.0 application and
   implication areas in the contract management of the AEC industry,
   including tender/bid phase, cost estimation, BIM contractual
   requirements, smart contracts, analyzing and monitoring contracts, claim
   and dispute management, information management and traceability,
   intellectual property rights; and regarding each topic, relevant I4.0
   technologies were identified. Finally, benefits, challenges, and gaps of
   the literature were identified based on systematic analysis results.
   This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying and
   synthesizing the current status of the research subject, and providing
   the researchers with the study's theoretical and practical
   contributions.},

Title = {Validation of technical requirements for a BIM model using semantic web
   technologies},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {60},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {While progressing through the different stages of a project in the
   architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector, a project must
   continuously comply with several requirements. Yet, human skills are
   often essential when it comes to validating these requirements, which
   can be error-prone and contributes to the loss of information in the
   information stream of a project. As has been indicated before, higher
   levels of automation can be achieved by describing, querying, and
   validating AEC project data using the technology stack offered by the
   Semantic Web (SW). Particularly the logical basis of these technologies
   (semantic rulechecking) is promising, as it allows a more consistent
   representation and checking of such requirements. As part of the
   development of a decentralized rule-checking system using SW open
   standards, this study investigates particularly to what extent the more
   challenging requirements can be checked, such as 3D geometric
   requirements and more ambiguous or vague requirements. Tangible and
   clear results described in this report are (1) a concise classification
   of rule types that apply to BIM models, (2) a system architecture for a
   semantic rule-checking system, and (3) a demonstration of this system
   through three use cases. The results show how 66\% of a document
   containing human-readable requirements can be validated automatically.
   Furthermore, a clear indication is given of how the semantic compliance
   check can be combined with 3D geometric compliance checks into a
   scalable web-friendly architecture.},

Abstract = {In this digital era, many industries have widely adopted the Internet of
   Things (IoT), yet its implementation in the construction industry is
   relatively limited. Integration of Construction 4.0 drivers, such as
   business information modeling (BIM), procurement, construction safety,
   and structural health monitoring (SHM), with IoT devices, provides an
   effective framework for applications to enhance construction and
   operational efficiencies. IoT and Construction 4.0 driver integration
   research, however, is still in its infancy. It is necessary to
   understand the present state of IoT adoption in the Construction 4.0
   context. This paper presented a comprehensive review to identify the IoT
   adoption status in the Construction 4.0 areas. Furthermore, this work
   highlighted the potential roadblocks to IoT's seamless adoption that are
   unique to the areas of Construction 4.0 in developing countries.
   Altogether, 257 research articles were reviewed to present the current
   state of IoT adoption in developed and developing countries, as well as
   the topmost barriers encountered in integrating IoT with the key
   Construction 4.0 drivers. This study aimed to provide a reference for
   construction managers to observe challenges, professionals to explore
   the hybridization possibilities of IoT in the context of Construction
   4.0, and laymen to understand the high-level scientific research that
   underpins IoT in the construction industry.},

Title = {Automation and optimization in crane lift planning: A critical review},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {49},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Safe and efficient crane operations play a significant role in
   successful delivery of construction projects, and thus meticulous
   planning of crane lifts becomes increasingly critical. Crane lift
   planning involves a series of complex decisions to be made, while
   satisfying a wide range of criteria and constraints. Conventionally,
   making these decisions is time-consuming and to a large extent relies on
   the planner's experience. To make more informed and optimized planning
   decisions, past research works investigated various automated planning
   techniques and optimization algorithms. However, most studies focus on
   an individual planning decision or a particular lifting scenario, which
   makes the findings hard to be generalized. Thus, the knowledge in lift
   planning is rather fragmented and the state-of-the-art in lift planning
   is not explicitly presented. This study, therefore, aims to conduct a
   critical review and assessment on the literature on crane lift planning
   automation and optimization and to establish a solid foundation to
   inform future research. It first presents an overview of the literature
   in crane lift planning with respect to the planning decision and the
   type of cranes the studies focus on. Secondly, for each lift planning
   decision, the assumptions, objectives, decision variables, and
   constraints are formulated based on the literature and analyzed from the
   perspectives of problem formulation coherence. Furthermore, each problem
   solving method is evaluated with regard to a tri-axial evaluation
   diagram to allow an in-depth discussion on the efficacy and practicality
   of planning results. Finally, based on the discussion and existing
   literature, a BIM based lift planning framework is presented and future
   research directions are recommended to further improve the effectiveness
   and efficiency of lift planning practice.},

Title = {Adding value through enterprise building information models in
   health-care services},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-70},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {PurposeThe main aim of this paper is to describe the potential benefits
   of enterprise building information models (EBIMs) for health-care
   institutions. The main research question addressed is how data from EBIM
   could be leveraged to create value for hospitals beyond design,
   construction and traditional facility management.
   Design/methodology/approachThree different prototypes, which use
   different technologies in combination with EBIM, are described to
   illustrate different uses of EBIM within the context of a hospital and
   health-care operations. The case study approach has been used to present
   the prototypes. FindingsEBIM data, in combination with other data
   sources, increases the potential benefits of the data with respect to
   many health-care-related processes, during the operation of a
   health-care institution. The benefits of EBIM span beyond the design and
   construction life cycle phases of a hospital and provide value to a
   variety of stakeholders in multiple health-care-related processes.
   Research limitations/implicationsThe main limitation of this work is the
   limited sources of data and information such as the specific methods
   that were used in the design and development of each of the prototypes
   and a deeper insight into the design rationale and decisions. Another
   limitation of this paper is that the findings have not been validated.
   Practical implicationsThis study demonstrates the value of convergence
   of a number of technologies such as EBIM, data and different types of
   technologies, throughout the life cycle of a building. This study also
   highlights the value of building information models (BIMs) data for
   supporting the design of novel educational and other types of
   application areas. The practical implications include the value for
   multiple stakeholders, such as resources planning, fleet and equipment
   management and contract negotiation. Benefits identified for resource
   planning can have strategic and financial implications at the management
   level. For patients, visitors and health-care personnel, there may be
   reduced infections, cleaner and pleasant facilities as well as a
   reduction of time to find relevant resources. Social implicationsSocial
   implications{''} could be replaced by ``For patients, visitors and
   health-care personnel, there may be cleaner and pleasant facilities and
   easy navigation support through the hospital. Furthermore, enhanced
   access to knowledge and information about the artefact and assets in the
   hospital can enhance learning and knowledge sharing.
   Originality/valueThis study identifies the lack of research in using BIM
   with other data for value-added services for multiple stakeholders in
   the operations phase of a hospital and addresses that research gap.},

Title = {Adaptive Terrain Modeling for Side-Slope Surfaces},
Journal = {SYMMETRY-BASEL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Three-dimensional site modeling is an important aspect of Building
   Information Modeling (BIM), especially in mountainous areas. Accurate
   site modeling is essential for efficient construction planning and
   resource allocation. A key issue in site modeling is how to accurately
   calculate the shape of side-slopes. It involves three sub-problems:
   geometric representation of side-slopes, determination of fill/cut
   types, and intersection of side-slopes surface with the terrain surface.
   To address this, a two-stage method for constructing side-slope models
   adaptive to terrain is proposed. In the first stage, a marching
   algorithm along polylines is used to calculate the intersection points
   of the site boundary polylines with the terrain surface. These
   intersection points are used to segment the boundary polylines. A
   rule-based approach is then applied to automatically determine the
   fill/cut type for each segment. Subsequently, the equations of the
   side-slopes passing through each segment are derived using geometric
   principles. In the second stage, a marching algorithm along the plane is
   used to trace the intersection lines of side-slopes with the terrain.
   Finally, the side-slopes are rendered with precision by integrating the
   equations of each segment with the determined intersection lines. The
   effectiveness of the method is verified through illustrative examples.
   Algorithm efficiency analysis and 3D modeling illustrations have
   demonstrated that this method not only boasts accuracy and swift
   computation but also excels in the level of automation achieved in the
   modeling process.},

Title = {ASSET INFORMATION MODEL REQUIREMENTS FOR INDUSTRIAL FACILITY},
Journal = {EURASIAN MINING},
Year = {2023},
Number = {2},
Pages = {104-109},
Abstract = {An Asset Information Model (AIM) is increasingly being developed to
   manage an industrial facility efficiently and safely. Despite many
   studies and current regulatory documentation, the topical issue is
   creating the AIM industrial facility requirements. Given the complexity
   and intensity of processes at an industrial facility's operation stage,
   the requirements development for AIM creating is an urgent issue. This
   article is focused on the study of requirements, including three general
   components: level of development (LOD), level of information (LOI) and
   level of accuracy (LOA) of model elements. In the research, the key
   components that should be contained in AIM have been identified, and the
   LOD and LOI requirements are developed based on research. A new level
   LOD 550 is introduced to solve deformation monitoring problems. The LOA
   specification for AIM elements and requirements for the accuracy of
   determining the spatial position of elements is developed. Lastly, the
   requirements for laser scanning and modeling objects accuracy are
   formulated. This study provides insight into a general idea of the AIM
   requirements and helps developers and users create AIM for solving
   operation tasks based on this information.},

Title = {Automated joint 3D reconstruction and visual inspection for buildings
   using computer vision and transfer learning},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Regular building inspection and maintenance has been deemed as a
   necessary preventive measure to maintain the functionality, integrity
   and aesthetics of buildings. 2D computer vision has demonstrated a good
   capability in detecting and classifying surface defects, but such 2D
   image-based methods provided limited support to represent the global
   information of defects concerning their positions and affecting areas
   for the entire building. Therefore, this paper presents an automated
   2D-3D computer vision approach, with the aid of transfer learning, for
   joint 3D reconstruction and visual inspection of buildings. A new
   methodology framework is established to integrate the mechanism of 3D
   scene reconstruction with the transfer learning model towards automated
   identification of building surface defects on reconstructed 3D scenes.
   Defect identification and visualisation are accomplished with a revamped
   ResNet-50 model and Grad-CAM technique. The overlayed images with
   defects information are prepared as inputs for 3D reconstruction along
   with depth maps, which are realised by AD-census cost computation and
   semi-global matching optimisation algorithms. The proposed new methods
   are demonstrated via an illustrative example which promptly detects
   surface defects on the 3D scene and underpins smart facility maintenance
   management.},

Title = {Multi-domain ubiquitous digital twin model for information management of
   complex infrastructure systems},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {56},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Digital twin is a comprehensive digital equivalent of an object or an
   activity, reflecting the semantic and geometric properties and behaviors
   through virtual models and data. Digital twin and related information
   technologies are widely used in the construction, operation and
   maintenance of infrastructure and facility. Transdisciplinary
   stakeholders are always involved in the long-term and cross-scene
   management of IoT and digital twin-enabled smart infrastructures and
   facilities. The intensive interactions among stakeholders often cause
   conflicts due to the variations in experience, knowledge, and interests.
   Moreover, with the change propagation of digital twins, cyber-physical
   resources can't be efficiently and consistently established, connected,
   and utilized with multi-domain information through selective
   simplification and structured methods. This paper proposes a Ubiquitous
   Digital Twin model for the information management of complex
   infrastructure systems based on Domain-Driven Design. To achieve the
   unified and structured description, six domains are deployed in the
   proposed model with sequential or parallel tuples for shared
   understanding of overall system framework or specific functional
   modules. Three cases of one smart nuclear plant management scenario are
   hierarchically instantiated to evaluate the proposed model.},

Title = {Design Optimization of Building Exit Locations Based on Building
   Information Model and Ontology},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {There are usually multiple functional spaces that meet different usage
   needs on each building floor. The number of people in different
   functional spaces varies, resulting in an uneven distribution of people
   on each floors. When the building is subject to hazards, users inside
   buildings usually evacuate to safe areas through safety exits.
   Obviously, when the exit location is close to the crowded area, more
   people can be evacuated as quickly as possible. However, existing
   methods for optimizing exit locations of buildings mainly by shortening
   evacuation paths with limited considerations of the dynamic
   distributions of evacuees. Since the ontology has semantic description
   capability and reasonability. Therefore, the ontology is used to
   organize the design information related to the optimization of exit
   locations. The rules are further set to reason about the distribution of
   evacuees and the optimal exit location. Therefore, a design optimization
   method for exit locations based on BIM and ontology is proposed.
   Firstly, the ontology is developed to describe the information needed
   for design optimization. Then, the plan layout information is extracted
   from BIM as ontology instances. Next, based on the evacuation
   simulations, the exit location optimization strategies were created for
   the different distribution of evacuees, and the strategies were
   translated into SWRL rules. Finally, the ontology instance and SWRL
   rules are combined to reason about the exit location optimization
   strategies for specific projects. Therefore, this study provided the
   exit location optimization strategies to make the evacuation time
   shorter by considering the distribution of evacuees. The automation of
   exit location reasoning is further enhanced by using the constructed
   ontology to organize the design information and by transforming the
   optimization strategies into SWRL rules. The feasibility of the method
   was verified using several cases. By comparing the evacuation time of
   people under the exit location recommended by this method and the exit
   location designed by the shortest evacuation path, it is concluded that
   the method proposed in this paper takes into account the distribution of
   people in the plane and the evacuation time is shorter.},

Title = {Quantification of economic influences on technology adoption and
   diffusion in the construction industry},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 8},
Abstract = {The construction industry has been slow to adopt technologies like
   design automation and robotic fabrication due to high initial costs and
   long project cycles. However, demand for efficiency, sustainability and
   safety has spurred technological transformation. This study explores how
   technology spreads in construction by examining mimetic behaviour among
   enterprises of varying income levels using an agent-based modelling
   (ABM) approach. The model uses empirical data from literature to
   simulate interactions and economic impacts on adoption across high-,
   medium- and low-income enterprises. Findings show that high-income firms
   adopt technologies during economic growth to strengthen market position,
   while low-income firms invest during downturns to cut costs and enhance
   competitiveness. Medium-income firms adopt cautiously but steadily in
   stable growth scenarios. These results highlight economic conditions and
   income differences in shaping adoption strategies, offering insights for
   policymakers promoting technology diffusion in construction. As a
   premise work to explore quantifiable economic impact of technology
   adoption, this study has reviewed key economic drivers and barriers that
   may influence technology diffusion across different enterprise
   categories. Coupled this with the ABM findings, this study offers
   construction managers practical insights to align technology investments
   with economic trends, enabling them to reduce risks and enhance
   competitiveness under varying market conditions.},

   categorization using web crawling and Natural Language Processing
   techniques},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {282},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Eco-labels are extensively employed to assess the environmental
   performance of building materials. However, their management is often
   fragmented across disparate online databases with inconsistent data
   structures, presenting significant challenges for efficient information
   acquisition and management. This study explores the application of web
   crawling techniques, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine
   learning (ML) models to collect and categorize eco-label information,
   with the objective of advancing the automation of information management
   processes. The results demonstrate that the categorization models
   exhibit high performance, achieving F1-scores exceeding 0.95 on the test
   set and at least 0.76 when validating datasets incorporating temporally
   updated information. However, the limited availability of data for
   certain eco-labels, such as Forest Stewardship Council certification and
   Green Screen, substantially degrades model performance with updated
   data. Notably, traditional ML models leveraging manual feature
   engineering outperform deep learning models with automatic feature
   extraction when applied to web-crawled data. Furthermore, the TF-IDF
   feature extraction technique surpasses other n-gram-based approaches,
   with model performance declining as n-gram length increases. This study
   establishes a systematic framework that informs the selection of
   reliable data sources, feature engineering strategies, and ML algorithms
   for integrating web crawling, thereby enhancing the automation of
   eco-label information management.},

Abstract = {Expert systems represent ``IF-THEN{''} algorithms that integrate human
   expert knowledge to solve complex problems. This area of research
   focuses on finding solutions to challenging situations that are often
   difficult to resolve using traditional methods. Expert systems have
   widespread applications in the field of construction. The paper presents
   some of these applications, including their use in building maintenance,
   inspection of water and sewage systems, geotechnical engineering, road
   maintenance, and the selection of appropriate construction materials.
   Artificial neural networks are effective in optimizing financial plans,
   estimating the duration of activities, assessing the productivity of
   work teams, and selecting contractors. Genetic algorithms find their
   application in resource allocation, selecting optimal solutions for task
   scheduling and project costs, as well as in building maintenance, while
   fuzzy logic aids in risk analysis, project management, and cost
   estimation. Expert methods can be integrated into information systems to
   provide consistent information necessary for the effective management of
   construction projects. A review of published papers on the application
   of expert methods in construction shows that these methods are already
   significantly represented across all sectors of the construction
   industry, but also indicates that there are still substantial
   opportunities for their future application.},

Title = {Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Assembly Planning in
   Robot-Based Prefabricated Construction},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The adoption of robotics is promising to improve the efficiency,
   quality, and safety of prefabricated construction. Besides technologies
   that improve the capability of a single robot, the automated assembly
   planning for robots at construction sites is vital for further improving
   the efficiency and promoting robots into practices. However, considering
   the highly dynamic and uncertain nature of a construction environment,
   and the varied scenarios in different construction sites, it is always
   challenging to make appropriate and up-to-date assembly plans.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based
   method for automated assembly planning in robot-based prefabricated
   construction. Specifically, a re-configurable simulator for assembly
   planning is developed based on a Building Information Model (BIM) and an
   open game engine, which could support the training and testing of
   various optimization methods. Furthermore, the assembly planning problem
   is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and a set of DRL
   algorithms are developed and trained using the simulator. Finally,
   experimental case studies in four typical scenarios are conducted, and
   the performance of our proposed methods have been verified, which can
   also serve as benchmarks for future research works within the community
   of automated construction. Note to Practitioners-This paper is conducted
   based on the comprehensive analysis of real-life assembly planning
   processes in prefabricated construction, and the methods proposed could
   bring many benefits to practitioners. Firstly, the proposed simulator
   could be easily re-configured to simulate diverse scenarios, which can
   be used to evaluate and verify the operations' optimization methods and
   new construction technologies. Secondly, the proposed DRL-based
   optimization methods can be directly adopted in various robot-based
   construction scenarios, and can also be tailored to support the assembly
   planning in traditional human-based or human-robot construction
   environments. Thirdly, the proposed DRL methods and their performance in
   the four typical scenarios can serve as benchmarks for proposing new
   advanced construction technologies and optimization methods in assembly
   planning.},

Abstract = {Construction regulations ensure a base level of safety of built assets.
   Formal checking of built assets against regulations happens at defined
   points in their life-cycle, and often there is limited automation
   involved. The movement towards digitising and automation elements of
   physical site inspections paves the way towards a whole life-cycle
   approach for compliance checking. This paper explores whole life-cycle
   compliance checking. It does this by extending current checking
   processes which are common in the design and construction phases into
   the operational phase of the building life-cycle, proposing that the
   best way to achieve this is through automated/semi-automated data
   capture and analysis. To test the feasibility of this concept, this
   paper will review existing academic literature, analyse existing
   regulations and conduct proof of concept testing. This paper has found
   that the concept of whole-lifecycle compliance checking is becoming
   increasingly important to better monitor and assure high risks elements
   of the built environment. When applied to the operational phase, it,
   however, becomes impractical and expensive when relying on solely manual
   inspections. Furthermore, there is a significant quantity of viable use
   cases for this approach and that there are viable technologies to
   leverage them.},

Abstract = {Laboratory management automation is essential for achieving
   interoperability in the domain of experimental research and accelerating
   scientific discovery. The integration of resources and the sharing of
   knowledge across organisations enable scientific discoveries to be
   accelerated by increasing the productivity of laboratories, optimising
   funding efficiency, and addressing emerging global challenges. This
   paper presents a novel framework for digitalising and automating the
   administration of research laboratories through The World Avatar, an
   all-encompassing dynamic knowledge graph. This Digital Laboratory
   Framework serves as a flexible tool, enabling users to efficiently
   leverage data from diverse systems and formats without being confined to
   a specific software or protocol. Establishing dedicated ontologies and
   agents and combining them with technologies such as QR codes, RFID tags,
   and mobile apps, enabled us to develop modular applications that tackle
   some key challenges related to lab management. Here, we showcase an
   automated tracking and intervention system for explosive chemicals as
   well as an easy-to-use mobile application for asset management and
   information retrieval. Implementing these, we have achieved semantic
   linking of BIM and BMS data with laboratory inventory and chemical
   knowledge. Our approach can capture the crucial data points and reduce
   inventory processing time. All data provenance is recorded following the
   FAIR principles, ensuring its accessibility and interoperability.},

   toward Construction 4.0: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in the construction
   industry in the last decade for various purposes such as progress
   monitoring and building inspection. Recently, there has been a rising
   trend of employing UAVs with other digital technologies (DTs), such as
   Building Information Modeling and Extended Reality. The integration of
   these technologies encourages automation and digitization toward better
   project performance. However, little is known about the implementation
   of UAVs in conjunction with other DTs. Therefore, this study performs a
   systematic literature review to determine application areas and
   technology trends regarding UAVs' integration with other DTs. The search
   yielded 287 articles, of which 36 satisfied the established inclusion
   criteria and formed the foundation of this systematic review. Seven
   application areas of UAV integration with other DTs were identified:
   progress monitoring, historic building conservation, information
   management, construction safety, construction education, structural and
   infrastructure inspection, and transportation. This study also revealed
   UAV technology trends encouraging automation and digitization: automated
   progress monitoring, automated UAV inspection planning, real-time video
   streaming, and parametric model development of historicbuildings. This
   study is expected to be a starting point of future in-depth research by
   providing a general understanding of the current applications of UAVs
   integration with other DTs.},

Title = {A TOOL-BASED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE FOR A DIGITAL TWIN: A CASE STUDY IN A
   HEALTHCARE FACILITY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {107-137},
Abstract = {Changes in the local and global markets are forcing A/E/C/FM
   (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility Management)
   organizations to deliver more robust and innovative operational BIMs
   (Building Information Models). It is hypothesized that BIMs will
   transform from a static 3D model to a Digital Twin providing a truly
   digital representation of the physical asset or the building it
   represents. This transformation to a dynamic Digital Twin will allow the
   A/E/C/FM industry to visualize, monitor, and optimize operational assets
   and processes to support better inspection and analysis for a more
   efficient facility operations and maintenance. To support the adoption
   and implementation of Digital Twin in A/E/C/FM, the authors have defined
   two clear objectives. First, we discuss requirements for a
   functionality-based canonical architecture to create a digital twin
   followed by proposing two tool-based system architecture options for its
   implementation. Second, we use a case study approach to develop a
   proof-of-concept Digital Twin of an operating room in a healthcare
   facility using Power BI Desktop and Azure Services. The prototype aims
   to monitor room air quality as per INAIL (National Institute for
   Insurance against Accidents at Work) and ISO (International Organization
   for Standards) standards. Multiple sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi 4
   are used to capture real-time data for various air quality parameters
   including temperature, humidity, airflow, particulate contamination, and
   Nitrous Oxide (N2O) gas. Multiple dashboards are also created to
   visualize, monitor, and analyze the data harnessed from the OR sensors.
   The implementation addresses critical issues including security, data
   storage, visualization, processing, data streaming, collection, and
   analysis. As an initial validation, the Digital Twin prototype was
   presented and discussed with a healthcare BIM manager. Initial feedback
   from the industry expert indicated that the prototype could decrease the
   required time to respond to facility maintenance issues such as
   decreased air flow due to possible obstructions.},

Title = {Autonomous Building Design for Manufacturing and Assembly: A Systematic
   Review of Design Application, Challenges, and Opportunities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The growing demand for sustainable and affordable construction, paired
   with labor shortages, requires more efficient tools and methodologies.
   Industrialized construction (IC) is one solution that has the ability to
   address construction efficiency by utilizing techniques such as
   modularization, construction automation, and building information
   modeling. One particular aspect of IC is Design for Manufacture and
   Assembly (DfMA) since the design phase determines up to 80\% of the
   operating costs. However, DfMA is yet to be implemented in the
   construction industry due to some challenges in DfMA that inhibit full
   implementation. The majority of construction manufacturers have to
   regenerate the construction drawings for manufacturing which add
   substantial time to the schedule. Delays are caused by the lack of
   coordination of these components, as well as assemblies' connections,
   compliance with building codes, and other related policies. Although
   many scholarly manufacturing and assembly works have studied and
   reviewed various aspects, techniques, and applications of DfMA, none
   have looked at the design process, tools and methods, or challenges in
   design automation. Using a systematic literature review, this study
   reviews the most recent innovative design responses for manufacturing
   and assemblies, and tools and methods. The study then analyzes the
   identified challenges of DfMA automation and processes in the existing
   literature on the construction industry, such as the lack of autonomous
   design and construction manufacturing. The literature analysis suggests
   future studies are required to improve DfMA not only as a technique but
   as a design strategy, particularly during the design process and prior
   to the production phase. Finally, future directions are provided to lead
   the next generation of research to advance building construction.
   Significantly, the results of this research provide an up-to-date status
   on autonomous DfMA and contribute to the body of knowledge of IC by
   synthesizing the state-of-the-art of building design automation and
   methods for manufacture and assembly.
   Shifting the construction work from a jobsite to a factory environment
   and utilizing automation are resolutions to a lack of construction
   efficiency. Factory automation highly relies on DfMA processes.
   Automating the manufacturing process itself requires advanced knowledge,
   particularly DfMA; which is a common term referring to both management
   and technology that enables designers to ease a product's material
   selection, cost, and factory production. Studies have addressed the
   state-of-the-art for DfMA, but none have looked at the design process
   from the early design stage, tools and methods, and the associated
   challenges. This paper provides a review of design automation techniques
   in various thematic categories including (1) design scale, from an
   entire building scale to a small component like a wall, (2) design
   parameters like structural strengths and sustainability, (3) building
   material types, (4) tools and methods, and (5) the challenges for
   implementation. The provided paper is a fundamental resource for DfMA
   research in construction manufacturing. Manufacturers, developers, and
   builders require such a resource to learn more about various aspects of
   the design process and associated challenges to either improve their
   production lines or establish new state-of-the-art factories.},

Abstract = {Construction is a sector that has been operating with lower productivity
   rates than other industries; historically, it has used artisanal
   methods, which have generated low competitiveness and efficiency,
   leading to considerable cost overruns and waste. For these reasons, the
   industrial revolution 4.0 is a movement involving large-scale changes
   and a transversal implementation of technology in industries' value
   chains. In the same way, the basic principles of Industry 4.0 can be
   applied to the construction sector in the term Construction 4.0, a
   movement that seeks to integrate new technologies with the processes of
   the industry, generating added value that allows for increased
   productivity, and close gaps with other industries. Therefore, a
   bibliometric analysis focused on Cluster analysis is presented, which
   allows knowing the research state of Construction 4.0 and its
   implications in developing the Construction sector. The search equation
   in the Web of Science (WOS) database was queried by topic (Construction
   4.0), from which 225 scientific articles related to the subject were
   obtained. These articles are directly related to this new movement from
   new materials, more efficient construction processes, BIM, Digital Twin
   (DT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and other topics of research
   relevance in Construction 4.0. The main results show low research
   participation of Latin America in implementing technologies and
   methodologies offered by Construction 4.0. In contrast, developed
   countries, such as the United Kingdom, China, the United States, and
   Australia, show a greater interest in research and adopting these
   trends.},

Title = {Future directions and research gaps in city information modelling (CIM)},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAY 20},
Abstract = {Purpose - The study aimed to provide a comprehensive review and
   bibliometric analysis of City Information Modelling (CIM) research,
   focusing on its development, key contributions, and future directions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodology combined bibliometric
   analysis and systematic review to critically examine the research gaps
   and future directions in CIM utilising the Web of Science (WoS), Scopus
   and Emerald Insight databases. The bibliometric analysis performed using
   VOSviewer combined the three databases to analyse 446 documents to
   identify publication trends, citation patterns and research hotspots
   combined the three databases. The bibliometric analysis is essential to
   understanding the field's structure and identifying key contributions to
   CIM research. The study utilised the PRISMA systematic review method to
   analyse 89 documents to uncover the research gaps and future directions.
   Findings - The study revealed that despite the upward growth of CIM
   research in 2023, CIM research remains fragmented, lacking a unified
   theoretical framework. Much of the existing work focuses on the
   technical integration of Building Information Modelling (BIM),
   Geographic information modelling (GIS), and the Internet of Things
   (IoT), often at the expense of socioeconomic and environmental
   considerations. A heavy reliance on limited case studies, small
   datasets, and past data hampers the generalizability of findings. While
   infrastructure, construction, and facility management dominate the
   discourse, there is comparatively little attention to governance,
   mobility, public-private partnerships, and social equity. To advance the
   field, the study identifies key areas for future research, such as
   developing governance frameworks, innovative asset management
   strategies, enhanced data security measures, and improved system
   interoperability. Emphasizing holistic and interdisciplinary approaches
   can enhance CIM's relevance and impact, enabling it to effectively
   address a wider range of urban challenges. Originality/value - This
   study addresses the fragmented state of CIM research by consolidating
   knowledge from diverse domains through the integration of bibliometric
   analysis and systematic review methods. It provides a framework for
   understanding CIM's potential in smart, sustainable urban development.
   The findings underscore the need for holistic, data-driven approaches to
   inform policy and practice, offering new insights into the field's
   trajectory.},

Title = {Identifying Emerging Technologies and Skills Required for Construction
   4.0},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Connectivity, digitization, and emerging Industry 4.0 technology such as
   AI, automation, robotics, IoT, and cyber-physical space have transformed
   social relations, the means of production, and the world of labor. The
   construction industry has also been transformed by Industry 4.0
   technologies, mainly through Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based
   digitization. This revolution in the construction industry has been
   called Construction 4.0 and is based on the use of innovative
   technologies that promote digitalization and automation of design,
   construction, and management processes. Furthermore, the workforce for
   the construction industry in the context of Construction 4.0 must have
   adequate skills for this new scenario. Previous literature reviews have
   analyzed the idea of transitioning the construction industry to
   Construction 4.0 and implementing specific technologies in the industry.
   However, there has been limited exploration of the skills necessary for
   the Construction 4.0 workforce. This article aims to address this gap by
   identifying the technologies and skills that have been scientifically
   researched and applied in the construction industry, specifically
   related to the concepts of Industry 4.0 and Construction 4.0. Utilizing
   a scoping literature review in the Scopus database, this study seeks to
   identify: (i) emergent C4.0 technologies in the AEC industry; and (ii)
   which skills or competencies are demanded when using these technologies.
   All of our bibliographical searches are inserted and restricted to the
   concept of Construction 4.0. A total of 108 articles related to
   technologies and 15 related to skills in the Construction 4.0 context
   were selected for analysis. Twenty-one technologies were identified and
   grouped into five sets according to their similarities and applications:
   AI-assisted technologies, Advanced manufacture, Smart tools, Digital
   simulation/Visualization, and Data acquisition/detection. The skills
   were identified and grouped into soft and hard skills. However, the
   findings point out that the new skills needed by the workforce are
   described in a dispersed way, without a central theme of research in the
   context of Construction 4.0. Our findings contribute to a better
   understanding of the transformations towards Construction 4.0 and
   provide data for industry and universities to respond appropriately to
   the new demands of the construction industry.},

Title = {Design information extraction from construction specifications to
   support cost estimation},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {131},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Construction cost estimation is a labor-intensive task that involves
   several processes. Although some of these processes have been automated,
   construction cost estimation still relies heavily on manual inputs. To
   compute a cost estimate, an estimator needs to: (1) take off quantities
   and extract some required cost information from the architectural model
   or drawing; (2) extract other required cost information from the
   construction specifications; (3) assign building elements to work or
   cost items; and (4) retrieve the unit cost of the work or cost items to
   further compute the cost estimate. To achieve full automation of
   construction cost estimation, the manual inputs required to classify
   building elements, and to retrieve pricing information of work items
   need to be automated. To address that, the authors proposed a new method
   that uses semantic modeling and natural language processing techniques
   in developing algorithms that automate the manual processes involved in:
   (1) extracting design information from construction specifications; (2)
   using the extracted information to match specified material in the
   construction specifications with items from an established database; and
   (3) retrieving the pricing information of the materials specified in the
   construction specifications. To test the validity of the authors'
   proposed method, an experiment was conducted using eight wood
   construction projects in Detroit, MI. The proposed method was utilized
   to develop an algorithm that can process the construction specifications
   automatically and retrieve the unit cost of materials from a database.
   The results from the developed algorithm were compared with the gold
   standard (results manually generated by industry experts). The developed
   algorithms achieved 99.2\% precision and 99.2\% recall (i.e., 99.2\%
   F1-measure) for extracted design information instances; 100\% precision
   and 96.5\% recall (i.e., 98.2\% F1-measure) for extracted materials from
   the database. The authors demonstrated that as the training data
   increases, the performance levels increase. The developed algorithms
   utilized 5.56\% of the time it took using the current traditional method
   of extracting design information from construction specifications
   manually. These results showed that the proposed method is promising in
   developing algorithms that automate the processing of construction
   specifications to extract the design related information in fulfilling
   essential information requirements of detailed wood construction cost
   estimation and in retrieving the unit costs.},

Abstract = {Automating on-site assembly benefits quality and productivity, reduces

   of high-payload real-scale form-fit timber components and demonstrates
   the automated process on a real construction site. All methods are
   explained from the development of two large-scale on-site assembly
   manipulators and end-effectors for picking up, transporting, placing and
   connecting components to automated data extraction of the BIM model,
   path planning, trajectory generation, feedback control, and practical
   tests with robotic total station measurements. The on-site assembly
   process is semi-automated, which demonstrates its feasibility. A
   comparison to a simulated benchmark that exploits all speed limits shows
   the automation potential. Positioning error sources and approaches for
   error compensation and avoidance are discussed for future work.},

Abstract = {Although novel construction tech systems have been developed to monitor
   construction sites, each collects data in isolation. We present an event
   processing model (EPM) that applies multiple monitoring technologies in
   parallel and a set of algorithms to interpret data from the multiple
   streams for operations control. In a full-scale lab experiment, multiple
   monitoring systems were applied to monitor workers as they built drywall
   partitions with a variety of systems and finishes. Data from the
   different streams were merged to establish what work was done, by whom,
   where, and for how long. The results suggest that collecting, merging,
   and interpreting diverse data streams using a multiple monitoring
   technologies system on-site can provide more complete and more accurate
   project status information than can be obtained from the use of any
   individual technology. This is essential for the automation of project
   progress monitoring, which is important in automating production
   planning and control tasks.},

Title = {Ontology-based manufacturability analysis automation for industrialized
   construction},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {139},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The current digital fabrication workflow requires many iterations
   between design and manufacturing. Automated manufacturability analysis
   can reduce the number of iterations at the design stage. However,
   existing approaches that leverage design for manufacturing and assembly
   (DfMA) do not consider detailed product features and production
   capabilities. To address this limitation, this paper utilizes an
   ontology-based approach to connect design and manufacturing knowledge.
   The developed manufacturability analysis system (MAS) involves semantic
   reasoning to analyze manufacturability by combining feature-based
   modelling, production capability modelling and manufacturing rules. The
   system was tested on a timber panelized project to demonstrate complex
   manufacturability analysis capability. The testing proves that the
   system could provide real-time feedback to the designers, leading to
   fewer design iterations. Thus, the paper is a first step towards
   automated fabrication-aware design and the results from the study lay
   the foundation for future research on connecting knowledge for
   interdisciplinary rule checking},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Automated compliance checking brings advantages to the built environment
   but, currently, there has been no meaningful adoption, despite the
   increasing maturity of asset information models.
   This paper addresses this by ascertaining the blockers/obstacles to
   adoption and develops a road-map to overcome them. This work has been
   conducted in the UK and a road-map has been produced to drive forward
   adoption. More specifically this paper has; assessed the current state
   of the art in the field and engaged with industry to examine the
   attitudes to the digitisation of regulatory compliance processes.
   The results showed that industry believes that adoption of automation
   was both feasible and desirable, with the caveat that human oversight be
   maintained.
   Our road-map's methodical list of steps was judged to have the potential
   to bring the construction industry to the verge of mass
   industrialisation of automated compliance checking by 2025.},

Abstract = {Regular progress monitoring is essential to keep the project on track

   improved semantic segmentation-based framework was proposed for realtime
   progress tracking. The ECA mechanism and ASPP module were integrated
   into the U-Net to achieve precise segmentation. Subsequently, the actual
   progress was evaluated, and a work state identification algorithm was
   utilized to detect productivity-related issues, such as delays and
   interruptions. The approach was validated on a real construction
   project, achieving 90.85\% precision in segmentation. This study
   provides theoretical references for real-time progress monitoring and
   presents a feasible approach for construction productivity management.},

Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study presents a novel learning-guided point cloud vectorization to
   form the vector models of building components. To this end, two
   learning-based models are modified to realize feature detection and
   vectorization. The learning-guided scheme can comprehend the definition
   and mutual relationships of object vertices by learning through existing
   BIM models and thus predict the vector model of newly given point clouds
   consequently. Moreover, the effectiveness was verified by using point
   clouds under different quality levels. The quantitative indices showed
   promising results, in which the accuracy of object vertex positions
   achieved 10 cm in beam and column categories and less than 25 cm for all
   building components. On the other hand, the vertex connections of the
   vector models reported accuracy above 70\%. Therefore, the results can
   be deemed as fundamental models to improve the automation performance of
   further refinements or subsequent value-added applications.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {134},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {To support building permit issuing with automatic digital tools, the
   reuse of models produced by designers would make the process quicker and
   more objective. However, current studies and pilots often leave a gap
   with respect to the models as actually provided by architects, having
   varying quality and content. In this study, rather than taking a top
   down approach, we started from the available data and made the necessary
   inferences, which gave the opportunity to tackle basic and common issues
   often preventing smooth automatic processing. Specific characteristics
   of the IFC models were outlined and a tool was developed to extract the
   necessary information from them to check representative regulations.
   While the case study is specific in location, regulations and input
   models, the type of issues encountered are a generally applicable
   example for automated code compliance checking. This represents a solid
   base for future works towards the automation of building permits
   issuing.},

Abstract = {Healthcare facilities are pivotal in ensuring continuous access to
   services, particularly for individuals with complex health conditions.
   Effective asset information management (AIM) in these facilities through
   artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance operational efficiency. The
   exploratory bibliometric and systematic review assesses the status and
   trends of AI applications in AIM within healthcare facilities. The
   findings reveal a significant gap between research findings and
   practical implementation, highlighting the need for further integration
   and real-world usage of AI-powered solutions in healthcare facilities
   settings. This study identified notable gaps, including the need for
   research on utilising AI to enhance asset management in healthcare,
   including maintenance scheduling and procurement processes. Involving
   stakeholders, such as healthcare professionals, facility managers, and
   patients, in effective facility management using AI requires further
   investigation. Research is needed to evaluate the economic benefits and
   develop robust ethical guidelines for responsible AI implementation.
   Notably, previous research has given limited attention to AI for
   healthcare asset information management, with emerging trends focusing
   more on AI and infrastructure than the ``Asset{''} aspect. Implementing
   AI-powered solutions tailored to the unique needs of healthcare
   facilities and evaluating cost-effectiveness will lead to improved asset
   management practices, enhanced decision-making processes, and,
   ultimately, more efficient and effective healthcare operations.},

Abstract = {The climate change issue has been striking and bringing pressure on all
   countries and industries. The responsibility of the Architecture,
   Engineering, Construction and Facility Management (AEC/FM) industry is
   heavy because it accounts for over one-third of global energy use and
   greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the development of digital
   technology brings the opportunity to mitigate environmental issues.
   Therefore, this study intended to examine the state-of-the-art of
   digital development and transformation in the AEC/FM industry by
   collecting and reviewing the developed digital carbon footprint analysis
   tools in infrastructure, building, and city scopes. Specifically, this
   study (1) generated a review methodology for carbon footprint analysis
   results; (2) demonstrated the review results from the infrastructure,
   building, and city scopes, analysed and compared the results crossing
   the scopes from four aspects: carbon footprint analysis strategy,
   standards and protocols, rating systems, and general development level
   of digital tools; and (3) discussed the potential directions in the
   industry to address the environmental issues. This study indicated that
   the digitalisation level regarding carbon-related areas is still at an
   early stage, and efforts should be taken both academically and
   practically to drive the digital development confronting the harsh
   climate change issue.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses a main gap in the literature: the lack of a

   interconnections between DT applications, technologies, and data.
   Through a systematic review and thematic coding of 112 papers, this

   construction sites, which includes seven application areas (1. Safety
   and risk management; 2. Progress monitoring and control; 3. Supply chain

   management; 6. Construction robotics and automation; and 7.
   Sustainability and circular construction{''}) and 19 uses. The paper
   then identifies the interplays between each DT application, the five DT
   technological layers (i.e. sensing; communication; storage; analytics;
   and visualization), and the data utilized. These findings are crucial
   for developing DT solutions that effectively tackle the dynamic and

Title = {Automatic classification of common building materials from 3D
   terrestrial laser scan data},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {110},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Automatic building material classification has been a popular research
   interest over the past decades because it is useful for construction
   management and facility management. Currently, the proposed methods for
   automatic material classification are mainly based on 2D images by using
   the visual features of building materials. A terrestrial laser scanner
   (TLS) with a built-in camera can generate a set of coloured laser scan
   data that contain the surface geometries of building materials. The
   laser scan data include not only the visual features of building
   materials but also other attributes such as material reflectance and
   surface roughness. With more attributes provided, laser scan data have
   the potential to improve the accuracy of building material
   classification. Therefore, this research aims to develop a TLS
   data-based classification method for common building materials using
   machine learning techniques. The developed technique uses material
   reflectance, HSV colour values, and surface roughness as the features
   for material classification. A database containing the laser scan data
   of ten common building materials was created and used for model training
   and validation with machine learning techniques. Different machine
   learning algorithms were compared, and the best algorithm showed an
   average classification accuracy of 96.7\%, which demonstrated the
   feasibility of the developed method.},

Title = {Challenges and gaps with user-led decision-making for prioritizing
   maintenance work orders},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {A vast amount of work orders is submitted daily which is a critical
   component of management for any facility. The process taken for
   prioritizing work orders, however, shows a high dependency on the extent
   of knowledge and experience of responsible staff available and is
   challenged by inconsistency in data collection, and uncertainty in
   decision-making. Making decisions and responding to a high number of
   requests demand intensive labor hours resulting in delays causing issues
   for facility managers. The high number of service requests, various work
   orders, and the required balance between cost and budget highlight the
   importance of the need for improving work order processing to optimize
   time and cost of buildings' operation. Through review of the literature,
   unstructured and semi-structured interviews, and a qualitative analysis
   approach, this paper identifies various challenges and gaps in
   user-driven decision-making for processing work orders and determines
   best practices. The challenges identified include inconsistency in
   prioritizing orders, lack of data requirements and knowledge management,
   cognitive workload and biases, and inconsistency in data collection.
   Using data-driven decision-making methods can address existing
   challenges, improve the process of prioritizing work orders and enhance
   the quality of the work performed by timely responding to submitted
   requests. This will improve the operation and maintenance of building
   facilities and increase occupants' satisfaction.},

Title = {Image-based onsite object recognition for automatic crane lifting tasks},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {123},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The construction industry is suffering from aging workers and frequent
   accidents, as well as low productivity. Automation and robotics is
   regarded as a promising approach for enhancing the development of the
   industry, and the automatic operation of cranes, as an important aspect
   of construction, is attracting increasing attention. However, due to the
   complexity and dynamics of construction sites, it is difficult for
   cranes to automatically recognize and locate lifting objects (e.g.,
   precast facades and partitions) on site. To solve this problem, an image
   based automated onsite object recognition approach for the automatic
   operation of cranes is developed in this study. This is a fusion of
   Faster-R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network), Canny, Hough
   Transformation, Endpoint clustering analysis and Vertex-based
   Determining Model, to uniquely locate a lifting object with exact pose
   and extract its features (e.g., centroid coordinates, size, and color).
   Based on the extracted features, the lifting object can be retrieved in
   the database with the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) format of BIM
   (Building Information Modeling) to obtain more features for the
   automatic operation of a crane. It is shown from a field experiment that
   the developed approach is workable and has the potential to support the
   automatic operation of cranes. This contributes a basic approach to the
   automatic operation of cranes and promotes the rapid development of
   construction automation and robotics.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) technology has received immense attention over the
   years due to the promises it presents to various stakeholders in science
   and engineering. As a result, different thematic areas of DT have been
   explored. This is no different in specific fields such as manufacturing,
   automation, oil and gas, and civil engineering, leading to fragmented
   approaches for field-specific applications. The civil engineering
   industry is further disadvantaged in this regard as it relies on
   external techniques by other engineering fields for its DT adoption. A
   rising consequence of these extensions is a concentrated application of
   DT to the operations and maintenance phase. On another spectrum,
   building information modeling (BIM) is pervasively utilized in the
   planning/design phase, and the transient nature of the construction
   phase remains a challenge for its DT adoption. In this article, we
   present a phase-based development of DT in the architecture,
   engineering, and construction industry. We commence by presenting
   succinct expositions on DT as a concept and as a service, and establish
   a five-level scale system. Furthermore, we present separately a
   systematic literature review of the conventional techniques employed at
   each civil engineering phase. In this regard, we identified enabling
   technologies such as computer vision for extended sensing and the
   Internet of things for reliable integration. Ultimately, we attempt to
   reveal DT as an important tool across the entire life cycle of civil
   engineering projects, and nudge researchers to think more holistically
   in their quest for the integration of DT for civil engineering
   applications.},

Pages = {136-152},
Abstract = {The construction industry is a highly labor-intensive industry with a
   low degree of automation and digitization. However, as in the
   manufacturing industry, a `new order' is emerging for the way the
   construction industry works today. This study aims to present the
   transformation of construction supply chains (CSCs) in Industry 4.0 by
   considering each supply chain stage separately, where the main purpose
   is to determine the criteria for the integration of the CSC with the
   Industry 4.0 perspective. A literature review and a Delphi study were
   conducted, and thirteen criteria are proposed to show the integration of
   Industry 4.0 aspects and CSC stages. Furthermore, one of the multi
   -criteria decision -making (MCDM) methods, the Best -Worst method, is
   used to prioritize the criteria for guiding future implications during
   the transformation of construction supply chains. Among the six CSC
   stages, the design stage is the most important from the Industry 4.0
   perspective. In addition, client collaboration by ICT (BIM) during the
   design phase is the most important sub -factors' overall rank. Although
   there is a limited number of studies on the CSC, there are no empirical
   studies addressing the current digital age approach. As a result, there
   is a significant gap in the construction literature, and a thorough
   assessment of the building supply chain in an Industry 4.0 setting is
   lacking. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study
   to illustrate the transformation of CSCs in Construction 4.0 by looking
   at each supply chain stage separately.},

Title = {An Ontology-Based Representation of Vaulted System for HBIM},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, many efforts have been invested in the cultural
   heritage digitization: surveying, modelling, diagnostic analysis and
   historic data collection. Nowadays, this effort is finalized in many
   cases towards historical building information modelling (HBIM). However,
   the architecture, engineering, construction and facility management
   (AEC-FM) domain is very fragmented and many experts operating with
   different data types and models are involved in HBIM projects. This
   prevents effective communication and sharing of the results not only
   among different professionals but also among different projects.
   Semantic web tools may significantly contribute in facilitating sharing,
   connection and integration of data provided in different domains and
   projects. The paper describes this aspect specifically focusing on
   managing the information and models acquired on the case of vaulted
   systems. Information is collected within a semantic based hub platform
   to perform cross correlation. Such functionality allows the
   reconstructing of the rich history of the construction techniques and
   skilled workers across Europe. To this purpose an ontology-based vaults
   database has been undertaken and an example of its implementation is
   presented. The developed ontology-based vaults database is a database
   that makes uses of a set of ontologies to effectively combine data and
   information from multiple heterogeneous sources. The defined ontologies
   provide a high-level schema of a data source and provides a vocabulary
   for user queries.},

   Systematic Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The progress monitoring (PM) of construction projects is an essential
   aspect of project control that enables the stakeholders to make timely
   decisions to ensure successful project delivery, but ongoing practices
   are largely manual and document-centric. However, the integration of
   technologically advanced tools into construction practices has shown the
   potential to automate construction PM (CPM) using real-time data
   collection, analysis, and visualization for effective and timely
   decision making. In this study, we assess the level of automation
   achieved through various methods that enable automated computer vision
   (CV)-based CPM. A detailed literature review is presented, discussing
   the complete process of CV-based CPM based on the research conducted
   between 2011 and 2021. The CV-based CPM process comprises four
   sub-processes: data acquisition, information retrieval, progress
   estimation, and output visualization. Most techniques encompassing these
   sub-processes require human intervention to perform the desired tasks,
   and the inter-connectivity among them is absent. We conclude that
   CV-based CPM research is centric on resolving technical feasibility
   studies using image-based processing of site data, which are still
   experimental and lack connectivity to its applications for construction
   management. This review highlighted the most efficient techniques
   involved in the CV-based CPM and accentuated the need for the
   inter-connectivity between sub-processes for an effective alternative to
   traditional practices.},

Title = {Prospects for digital twin technology in the building modular
   construction and operation phases: A game theory-based analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {470},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Modular construction and operation significantly impact building
   lifecycle management, with various stakeholders playing key roles.
   Digital twin technology emerges as a cutting-edge tool for information
   exchange, management, and forecasting in the construction sector,
   offering comprehensive services for diverse stakeholders. However,
   research primarily explores potential applications and practical
   solutions, with limited focus on application strategies considering all
   stakeholders' interests. This gap hinders the transition of digital twin
   technology from theoretical to practical use. Addressing this, the paper
   employs game theory to develop models that analyze key stakeholder
   decisions during the modular construction and operational phases. It
   creatively introduces mathematical models for complex conditions in the
   operation phase and conducts numerical simulations. Findings show that
   the diffusion rate of digital twin technology significantly affects
   decision-making by main stakeholders in the construction industries in
   two stages. The diffusion rate in other industries influences the
   decision of facility management contractors from different backgrounds,
   yet its implementation ultimately depends on their status and
   profitability during the operation process. These diffusion rates are
   influenced by various factors like government subsidies, development
   costs, and revenues. To enhance the application rate of digital twin
   technology, the paper suggests initiating pilot projects, creating
   project pools, expanding industryuniversity-research collaborations, and
   implementing subsidies and incentive programs.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ROAD ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-26},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Road transportation plays a crucial role in society and daily life, as
   the functioning and durability of roads can significantly impact a
   nation's economic development. In the whole life cycle of the road, the
   emergence of disease is unavoidable, so it is necessary to adopt
   relevant technical means to deal with the disease. This study
   comprehensively reviews the advancements in computer vision, artificial
   intelligence, and mobile robotics in the road domain and examines their
   progress and applications in road detection, diagnosis, and treatment,
   especially asphalt roads. Specifically, it analyzes the research
   progress in detecting and diagnosing surface and internal road distress
   and related techniques and algorithms are compared. In addition, also
   introduces various road governance technologies, including automated
   repairs, intelligent construction, and path planning for crack sealing.
   Despite their proven effectiveness in detecting road distress, analyzing
   diagnoses, and planning maintenance, these technologies still confront
   challenges in data collection, parameter optimization, model
   portability, system accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance.
   Consequently, the integration of multidisciplinary technologies is
   imperative to enable the development of an integrated approach that
   includes road detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This paper addresses
   the challenges of precise defect detection, condition assessment, and
   unmanned construction. At the same time, the efficiency of labor
   liberation and road maintenance is achieved, and the automation level of
   the road engineering industry is improved.},

Abstract = {This research addresses the factors that impact the acceptance of
   AI-based technologies or products depending upon firm size in the
   construction industry, in which various corporates exist. In order to
   achieve the research goals, a technology acceptance model was applied to
   investigate the influencing factors in respect to adopting AI-based
   technologies or products. From the research results, technological and
   organizational factors were found to positively influence perceived
   usefulness and perceived ease of use. Corporate users perceived that
   technology is useful to their work and is easy to use when enough
   capital and education were invested prior to the company adopting
   AI-based technologies or products. It was found that perceived ease of
   use and perceived usefulness indicate satisfaction with new technology,
   and the higher the intention to use, the higher the satisfaction. In
   addition, as various information sharing and distribution channels
   increase, the frequency of use of new technologies or products also
   increases, not through traditional marketing, but through viral
   marketing via social media or promotion by influential persons or
   organizations. Furthermore, there are differences in the adoption of
   AI-based technologies or products depending on the size of the company.},

Title = {Agile Construction Digital Twin Engineering},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Digital twins have attracted a lot of attention recently. However, the
   current manifestations are merely digital shadows, lacking means for
   bidirectional data exchange, which makes their use for assisting the
   construction of buildings much more difficult. We argue that this is due
   to the lack of a systematic process for developing a digital twin during
   a building's life cycle. We argue to look for a solution by combining
   agile engineering with IT change management to establish an agile,
   change-driven process for engineering digital twins. Such a process, of
   course, deserves a qualitative assessment of the engineering process and
   the resulting digital twin. In the future, it should be possible to
   obtain a digital twin from a BIM-based design process by applying IT
   change management in an agile manner. This should happen under maximum
   automation and life cycle orientation. Our proposal is motivated by
   several years of interdisciplinary collaboration between civil
   engineering and computer science and evaluated using the Technology
   Acceptance Model. While the TAM is not specifically designed for digital
   twin methodologies, its application here aims to assess perceived
   usefulness and ease of use of DT methodologies from the user's
   perspective, without addressing scalability concerns. This aims to
   provide actionable insights to guide the refinement of the process
   model, aligning it with user requirements and achieving its intended
   outcomes. Our evaluation confirms the proposed process's perceived
   usefulness and ease of use, with robust correlations indicating strong
   acceptance potential among stakeholders. These results highlight the
   feasibility of the proposed approach and its alignment with expectations
   in real-world applications.},

   technologies in sustainability improvement of transportation
   construction projects: state-of-the-art and future directions},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Purpose-This systematic literature review aims to investigate the
   application and integration of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies in
   transportation infrastructure construction projects focusing on
   sustainability pillars. Design/methodology/approach-The study employs a
   systematic literature review approach, combining qualitative review and
   quantitative analysis of 142 academic articles published between 2011
   and March 2023. Findings-The findings reveal the dominance of Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) as a central tool for sustainability
   assessment, while other technologies such as blockchain and autonomous
   robotics have received limited attention. The adoption of I4.0
   technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, Augmented
   Reality (AR), and Big Data, has been prevalent for data-driven analyses,
   while Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs) and 3D printing are mainly being
   integrated either with BIM or in synergy with Artificial Intelligence
   (AI). We pinpoint critical challenges including high adoption costs,
   technical barriers, lack of interoperability, and the absence of
   standardized sustainability benchmarks. Originality/value-This research
   distinguishes itself by not only mapping the current integration of I4.0
   technologies but also by advocating for standardization and a
   synergistic human-technology collaborative approach. It offers tailored
   strategic pathways for diverse types of transportation infrastructure
   and different project phases, aiming to significantly enhance
   operational efficiency and sustainability. The study sets a new agenda
   for leveraging cutting-edge technologies to meet ambitious future
   sustainability and efficiency goals, making a compelling case for
   rethinking how these technologies are applied in the construction
   sector.},

Title = {Human-centred and BIM-integrated automated value analysis of buildings},

Abstract = {This paper presents a study on automated value analysis of buildings for
   supporting value-adding and human-centred decision making in building
   planning and design. The analysis was conducted using a proposed system
   for automatically analyzing the value of a building based on its
   properties and multidimensional stakeholder values. The system is
   integrated with building information modelling (BIM) and is composed of
   three modules: a stakeholder input capturing module, a building
   information extraction module, and a value analysis module. The value
   analysis relies on valuation models that are theoretically grounded in
   axiology (value theory) and integration theory. A set of experiments
   were conducted, using the proposed system, to analyze the impacts of
   alternative planning and design decisions on the value of buildings to
   the stakeholders. The results indicate that it is important that
   decision makers not only enhance a design's ability in fulfilling
   individual stakeholder values, but also account for the stakeholders'
   systems of value priorities and seek to create a high level of synergy
   between the value that the design fulfils and the personal value systems
   of the stakeholders. The research contributes to the body of knowledge
   by integrating the human element of value - the human values - into
   value analysis. It could promote improved information for making more
   value-adding and human-centred decisions, and it could provide a
   foundation for planning and designing buildings in a way that is
   synergistically aligned with human values. Since the current study is
   limited in scope, in the future, the authors will expand the analysis by
   studying different types and scales of buildings and considering
   additional stakeholder values.},

Abstract = {Purpose High rate of accidents continue to plague the construction
   industry. The advancements in safety technologies can ameliorate
   construction health and safety (H\&S). This paper aims to explore the
   use of emerging technologies as an effective solution for improving
   safety in construction projects. Design/methodology/approach Following a
   detailed literature review, a questionnaire survey was developed
   encompassing ten technologies for safety management and ten safety
   enablers using technologies in construction. A total of 133 responses
   were gathered from Malaysian construction practitioners. The collected
   quantitative data were subjected to descriptive and inferential
   statistical analyses to determine the meaningful relationships between
   the variables. Findings Findings revealed that the most effective
   emerging technologies for safety management are: building information
   modelling (BIM), wearable safety technologies and robotics and
   automation (R\&A). The leading safety enablers are related to improve
   hazard identification, reinforce safety planning, enhance safety
   inspection, enhance safety monitoring and supervision and raise safety
   awareness. Practical implications Safety is immensely essential in
   transforming the construction industry into a robustly developed
   industry with high safety and quality standards. The adoption of safety
   technologies in construction projects can drive the industry towards the
   path of Construction 4.0. Originality/value The construction industry
   has historically been slow to adopt new technology. This study
   contributes to advancing the body of knowledge in the area of
   incorporating emerging technologies to further construction safety
   science and management in the context of the developing world. By taking
   cognisance of the pertinent emerging technologies for safety management
   and the safety enablers involved, construction safety can be enhanced
   using integrated technological solutions.},

Title = {Digital Twins in Construction: Architecture, Applications, Trends and
   Challenges},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The construction field currently suffers from low productivity, a lack
   of expertise among practitioners, weak innovation, and lack of
   predictability. The digital twin, an advanced digital technology,
   empowers the construction sector to advance towards intelligent
   construction and digital transformation. It ultimately aims for highly
   accurate digital simulation to achieve comprehensive optimization of all
   phases of a construction project. Currently, the process of digital twin
   applications is facing challenges such as poor data quality, the
   inability to harmonize types that are difficult to integrate, and
   insufficient data security. Further research on the application of
   digital twins in the construction domain is still needed to accelerate
   the development of digital twins and promote their practical
   application. This paper analyzes the commonly used architectures for
   digital twins in the construction domain in the literature and
   summarizes the commonly used technologies to implement the
   architectures, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, data
   mining, cyber-physical systems, internet of things, virtual reality,
   augmented reality applications, and considers their advantages and
   limitations. The focus of this paper is centered on the application of
   digital twins in the entire lifecycle of a construction project, which
   includes the design, construction, operation, maintenance, demolition
   and restoration phases. Digital twins are mainly moving towards the
   integration of data and information, model automation, intelligent
   system control, and data security and privacy. Digital twins present
   data management and integration challenges, privacy and security
   protection, technical manpower development, and transformation needs.
   Future research should address these challenges by improving data
   quality, developing robust integration methodologies, and strengthening
   data security measures.},

Title = {BIM-based retrofit method (RBIM) for building envelope thermal
   performance optimization},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {256},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Retrofitting building envelope thermal performance is crucial to ensure
   adequate interior thermal com-fort of the building, minimize cooling
   load rate and, therefore, reduce overall building energy consump-tion.
   The retrofit process of an existing building envelope involves the
   design team selecting the best performing building materials and
   components based on various design variables and predefined design
   objectives. Worldwide, an overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) metric
   has been developed and used for assessing heat transfer through the
   building envelope. However, the application of OTTV implicates deal-ing
   with many design variables and much information, which makes the design
   decision-making process time-consuming and complicated. Furthermore,
   selecting the most appropriate design alternative in terms of OTTV
   performance while considering the most cost-effective design option
   could be a very chal-lenging task. Therefore, this research proposes a
   method for retrofitting building information modelling (RBIM) to achieve
   a tradeoff design set between two conflicting objectives, namely
   minimizing OTTV and minimizing the retrofit cost. The prototype system
   derived from this method integrates BIM authoring tools (e.g., Autodesk
   Revit (R)), visual scripting (e.g., Dynamo), and a non-dominated sorting
   genetic algo-rithm (NSGA-II) customized in MATLAB (R). The applicability
   of the proposed system is validated with a case study of an office
   building. The results show that the developed system provides a valuable
   design decision support system for retrofitting building envelope
   thermal performance while considering the retrofit cost. Additionally,
   the system shows an improved level of automation in terms of data
   manage-ment compared to the conventional methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {A discussion of digital transition impact on facility management of
   hospital buildings},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5/6, SI},
Pages = {389-406},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to contribute to the discussion of the following
   questions: How can the digital transition improve the management of the
   operation and maintenance of infrastructure in health-care facilities?
   What is the legacy for facility management (FM) teams in this
   post-COVID-19 management of hospital buildings?
   Design/methodology/approachBased on a literature review, this paper
   analyses and categorises existing research on the digital challenges for
   FM from 2011 until 2021 by conducting a qualitative and quantitative
   method of bibliometric analysis and discussing the status of digital
   transition impact on FM of the hospital buildings. FindingsThe trends
   and challenges of building information modelling, artificial
   intelligence and the Internet of Things identified and discussed in this
   paper aim to be as comprehensive as possible to grasp the situation of
   digital transition in the FM industry in the hospital buildings context.
   Regarding digital maturity, the limited number of publications
   highlights that control and management systems cannot fully manage the
   entire operational phase of hospital buildings. Giving intelligence to
   buildings will undoubtedly be the future. So making buildings reactive,
   interactive and immersive is an inevitable transformation for
   intelligent hospital building systems. Thus, the added value of
   digitalisation will help facility managers to overcome the issues
   pointed out in this paper to deal with the growing health demands and
   enable them to mitigate the impacts of a new and future pandemic.
   Originality/valueThe novelty of this paper is classifying and unifying
   facility managers' tendencies regarding high-level information
   management issues, which are lacking in the literature, with a focus on
   the approaches with potential and higher impact on FM in the hospital
   building context and the related steps that should be considered
   regarding data collection and data structures. These tendencies provide
   a set of new intelligent approaches and tools, which will increase the
   efficiency of processes, significantly impacting the potential of
   optimisation. Also, these trends can improve planning and management of
   scope, costs, environment and safety in the value chain of projects and
   assets, thus creating a more resilient and sustainable industry for
   facility managers in this post-COVID-19 management for hospital
   buildings.},

Title = {An intelligent framework for rework risk identification in prefabricated
   construction processes based on compliance checking},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 31},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study establishes an ontology-based framework for rework
   risk identification (RRI) by integrating heterogeneous data from the
   information flow of the prefabricated construction (PC) process. The
   main objective is to enhance the automation level of rework management
   and reduce the degree of reliance on human factors and manual
   operations.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed framework comprises
   four levels aimed at managing dispersed rework risk knowledge and
   integrating heterogeneous data. The functionalities were realised
   through an integrated ontology that aligned the rework risk ontology
   with the PC ontology. The ontologies were developed and edited with Prot
   \& eacute;g \& eacute;. Ultimately, the potential benefit of the
   framework was validated through a case study and an expert questionnaire
   survey.FindingsThe framework is proven to effectively manage rework risk
   knowledge and can identify risk objects, clarify risk factors, determine
   risk events, and retrieve risk measures, thereby enabling the
   pre-identification of prefabricated rework risk (PRR) and improving the
   automation level. This study is meaningful and lays the foundation for
   the application of other computer methods in rework management research
   and practice in the future.Originality/valueThis research provides
   insights into the application of ontology to solve rework risk issues in
   the PC process and introduces a novel risk management method for future
   prefabricated project research and practice. The findings have
   significant theoretical value in terms of enriching the methods of risk
   assessment and control and the information management system of
   prefabricated projects.},

   Management: Comprehensive PRISMA Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The increasing adoption of advanced technologies and the growing demand
   for automation have driven the development of innovative solutions for
   smart Facilities Management (FM). The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this
   trend, highlighting the need for greater automation in FM, including the
   use of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). Despite this momentum, AMR
   adoption remains in its early stages, with limited knowledge and
   research available on their practical applications in FM. This study
   seeks to explore the challenges that hinder the successful integration
   of AMRs in the FM industry. To achieve this, a systematic literature
   review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, encompassing
   three phases: identification, screening, and inclusion. The review
   covered 80 full-text articles published from 1994 to 2024, reflecting
   the growing interest in technological advancements for FM and the
   increased focus on AMR research. The study identified five key barriers
   specific to FM that affect AMR adoption: diverse operational contexts,
   poorly designed indoor environments, varying building occupants,
   multi-faceted FM functionalities, and differences in building exteriors.
   These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the unique
   challenges faced by FM professionals, offering valuable insights for
   organizations and AMR developers to consider during the adoption
   process. The research contributes to the field by providing a foundation
   for FM practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to develop
   strategies for overcoming these barriers and advancing the adoption of
   AMR technologies in FM.},

Abstract = {Construction industry adds more than 35 percent of global emissions
   through the entire lifecycle procedure of the structure. Every stage of
   construction process from raw material extraction to demolition is
   responsible for carbon emissions in the form of either embodied or
   operational carbon. Carbon emissions be reduced by implementing
   modernization and sustainability in building design typically with
   greater use of material resources such as recycled steel, recycled
   concrete using the circular economy concepts and automation tools. This
   study focuses on a case of a two-storey commercial structure located in
   Hyderabad, Telangana State in India to ascertain specifically the
   embodied carbon released during different stages of construction using
   standard empirical formulae. Enormous amounts of embodied carbon
   emissions were observed and an alternative approach of using sustainable
   materials such as Ferrock, recycled steel, etc. was proposed to mitigate
   the same. It is evident from the study that eco-friendly materials are
   the effective alternatives to promote carbon neutrality.

Abstract = {Purpose Lean management has been used in various constructions around
   the world for more than a quarter of a century, and it is an important
   factor in the construction of new projects. In relation to demolition
   management, only standards and codes and general principles of
   demolition of specific buildings were evaluated. The purpose of this
   study is providing relation between lean management on demolition
   processes of municipality buildings evaluated.
   Design/methodology/approach This study investigates the lean demolition
   of demolished and renovated buildings in a metropolitan area that can be
   extended to all cities. In the first stage, the effective factors in the
   demolition of the building based on lean management were identified
   through a valid questionnaire based on the valid Delphi approach.
   Social, economic and environmental considerations were considered in
   designing the appropriate questionnaire. Findings The modified approach
   between the fuzzy method and partial least squares was used to evaluate
   important variables. All of the modified processes were developed in
   MATLAB by the authors of this paper. The results show that
   customer-focused degradation parameter has the weakest effect and waste
   removal variable has the most effect on lean management.
   Originality/value Statistical results show that there is no significant
   difference between the effect of lean management on variables such as
   demolition time, quality and type of construction (p < 0.05).},

Title = {Defining and generating operation and maintenance management
   requirements in digital twin applications using the DT-GPT framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {104},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Implementing Digital Twin (DT) technology in Operation and Maintenance
   (O\&M) heavily relies on the continuous availability of information
   regarding asset conditions and performances. Therefore, this study aims
   to establish comprehensive guidelines for defining information
   requirements for various O\&M tasks during the design phase. To achieve
   this objective, data collection, interviews, and investigations were
   conducted to develop an O\&M requirements system, including model
   requirements, function requirements, and nongeometric data requirements.
   The importance and attributes of requirement factors were analyzed
   through the Kano-QFD model. Based on the O\&M requirements system, a
   virtual assistant framework named ``DT-GPT{''} that utilizes the
   Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) was developed to assist owners
   in creating guidelines according to their requirements. Evaluations and
   a case study were introduced to validate the potential of DT-GPT.
   Results illustrated that DT-GPT had a mean semantic similarity of 87.28
   \% in generating function lists, a mean accuracy of 92.76 \% in
   extracting components from design drawings, and a mean semantic

Title = {A Novel Method for Tunnel Digital Twin Construction and Virtual-Real
   Fusion Application},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Tunnels play important roles in integrated transport infrastructure. A
   digital twin reproduces a real tunnel scene in virtual space and
   provides new means for tunnel digital maintenance. Aiming at the
   existing problems of video fragmentation, separation of video and
   business data, and lack of two- and three-dimensional linkage response
   methods in tunnel digital operation, in this paper, we propose a novel
   method for tunnel digital twin construction and virtual-real integration
   operation. Firstly, the digital management requirements of tunnel
   operations are systematically analyzed to clarify the purpose of digital
   twin construction. Secondly, BIM technology is used to construct a
   static model of the tunnel scene that conforms to the real tunnel main
   structure. Thirdly, a three-dimensional registration and projection
   calculation method is proposed to integrate tunnel surveillance video
   into a three-dimensional virtual scene in real time. Fourthly,
   multi-source sensing data are gathered and fused to form a digital twin
   scene that is basically the same as the real tunnel traffic operations
   scene. Finally, a management model suitable for digital twins is
   discussed to improve the efficiency of tunnel operations and management,
   and a tunnel in China is selected to verify this method. The results
   show that the proposed method is helpful to realize the application of
   two- and three-dimensional linkages of tunnel traffic smooth, accident
   rescue, facility management, and emergency response, and to improve the
   efficiency of tunnel digital management.},

Abstract = {Purpose Effective information management can help real estate operators
   improve asset performance during use, reducing environmental impact. The
   purpose of this exploratory study is to identify and prioritise key
   drivers, challenges and opportunities relating to information
   management, from the point of view of a diverse cohort of facilities
   practitioners, with the aim of guiding future research direction and
   contributing to a comprehensive domain understanding.
   Design/methodology/approach Nine interviews are conducted across a broad
   sample of RE sectors, the respondents including six facility managers
   and three data managers. A thematic analysis results in the
   identification and ranking in terms of importance of 44 emergent themes.
   These themes are then grouped into abstracted categories for analysis
   and synthesis. Findings This study indicates that systemic rather than
   technical issues are the greatest barrier to effective IM for facilities
   practitioners, the interviews providing examples of practical measures
   which address these challenges, promoting lifecycle thinking. Alignment
   is also found between the facilities and data management cohorts
   regarding lifecycle thinking towards both physical assets and
   information. Practical implications This study provides direction for
   future developments in the facilities sector, suggesting the pursuit to
   address systemic issues as being both worthwhile and feasible.
   Originality/value The novelty of this study is the ranking and synthesis
   of practitioner priorities with regard to high-level IM issues which is
   lacking in the literature, with a focus to-date on case-specific
   technical integration.},

   automation procedure for Manhattan-world structures},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The paper presents a novel method for automatically creating semantic
   digital models for buildings in Manhattan environments from dense point
   cloud data. Unlike previous approaches, which rely solely on data-driven
   methods, our method integrates artificial intelligence with domain
   engineering knowledge to overcome challenges in indoor point cloud
   processing and geometry representation in complex layouts. A
   feature-based Decision Tree classifier extracts main building elements,
   utilized in a knowledge-based algorithm for 3D space parsing. On this
   basis, an optimization process generates parameterized floor plans, used
   to finally create volumetric digital models. The method was validated on
   datasets from the Technical University of Munich and Stanford
   University, achieving a mean accuracy of approximately 0.08 m for model
   placement and 0.06 m for estimating element parameters, which highlights
   its effectiveness for generating a building's semantic digital model.
   This approach underscores the potential of AI integration in digital
   twinning workflows for more automated solutions.},

Abstract = {With the aid of computer aided design (CAD) and building information
   modelling (BIM), as-built to as-designed comparison has seen many
   developments in improving the workflow of manufacturing and construction
   tasks. Recently, evolution has been centred around automation of scene
   interpretation from three-dimensional (3D) scan data. The scope of this
   paper is to assess assemblies as the installation process progresses and
   inferring if arising deviations are problematic (complex task). The
   adequacy of utilising unorganised point clouds to compliance check are
   trialled with a real life down-scaled prototype model in conjunction
   with a synthetic dataset. This work aims to highlight areas where large
   rework could be avoided, in part by the detection of potential clashes
   of components early in the pipeline installation process. With the help
   of an extracted model in the form of a point cloud generated from a
   scanned physical model and a 3D CAD model representing the nominal
   geometry, an operator can be made visually aware of potential deviations
   and component clashes during a pipeline assembly process.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Buildings are complex structures composed of heterogeneous elements;
   these require building management systems (BMSs) to dynamically adapt
   them to occupants' needs and leverage building resources. The fast
   growth of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has
   transformed the BMS field into a multidisciplinary one. Consequently,
   this has caused several research papers on data-driven solutions to
   require examination and classification. This paper provides a broad
   overview of BMS by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR)
   summarizing current trends in this field. Unlike similar reviews, this
   SLR provides a rigorous methodology to review current research from a
   computer science perspective. Therefore, our goal is four-fold: (i)
   Identify the main topics in the field of building; (ii) Identify the
   recent data-driven methods; (iii) Understand the BMS's underlying
   computing architecture (iv) Understand the features of BMS that
   contribute to the smartization of buildings. The result synthesizes our
   findings and provides research directions for further research.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the existing literature on
   Construction 4.0 technologies over the past decade and their most common
   applications in both research and practice, aimed at achieving three
   objectives. First, the search for the most relevant articles on
   Construction 4.0, published in the scientific literature, and small
   firms that are developing and delivering 4.0 technologies in the
   construction industry allows to identify the numerous applications
   associated with Construction 4.0. Second, the applications found in the
   scientific literature and those identified in practice are classified
   and compared based on a framework consisting of three distinct axes.
   Third, the classification framework highlights current research trends
   and potential areas for future research, which can be summarized as
   follows: (i) development of hybrid digital solutions; (ii) alignment
   with effective collection of more structured data, smart interactive web
   technologies, robotics, autonomous systems, and intelligent built
   assets; and (iii) strengthen the capacities of artificial intelligence
   and machine learning.},

Title = {BIM-Based Registration and Localization of 3D Point Clouds of Indoor
   Scenes Using Geometric Features for Augmented Reality},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Augmented reality can improve construction and facility management by
   visualizing an as-planned model on its corresponding surface for fast,
   easy, and correct information retrieval. This requires the localization
   registration of an as-built model in an as-planned model. However, the
   localization and registration of indoor environments fail, owing to
   self-similarity in an indoor environment, relatively large as-planned
   models, and the presence of additional unplanned objects. Therefore,
   this paper proposes a computer vision-based method to (1) homogenize
   indoor as-planned and as-built models, (2) reduce the search space of
   model matching, and (3) localize the structure (e.g., room) for
   registration of the scanned area in its as-planned model. This method
   extracts a representative horizontal cross section from the as-built and
   as-planned point clouds to make these models similar, restricts
   unnecessary transformation to reduce the search space, and corresponds
   the line features for the estimation of the registration transformation
   matrix. The performance of this method, in terms of registration
   accuracy, is evaluated on as-built point clouds of rooms and a hallway
   on a building floor. A rotational error of 0.005 rad and a translational
   error of 0.088 m are observed in the experiments. Hence, the geometric
   feature described on a representative cross section with transformation
   restrictions can be a computationally cost-effective solution for indoor
   localization and registration.},

Abstract = {The development of digital transformation in the construction industry
   has led to the increasing adoption of smart contracts. As programmable
   applications to automatically write, verify, and enforce transaction
   conditions, smart contracts can be used in different areas mainly to
   improve automation level, information security, and built digital
   environment enhancement. However, the smart contract is commonly
   mentioned as a blockchain appendage, while its unique connotation and
   value in the construction industry have not been recognized Therefore,
   this study carries out a systematic review based on 81 research articles
   published from 2014 to 2021 on smart contract applications in
   construction to explore and highlight their potentials under
   domain-specific requirements. Results are analyzed according to research
   type categorization and domain codification. Eight research domains are
   identified, where the three most highly explored domains are contract
   and payment, supply chain and logistics, and information management. The
   integration of smart contracts with other innovative concepts and
   advanced technologies is analyzed. The applicability, benefits, and
   challenges of smart contract applications regarding different research
   domains are discussed.},

Title = {Enhanced robotic cross-laminated timber panel assembly process},
Journal = {DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {22},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The use of Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) panels in construction is often
   constrained by their weight, making handling and installation
   challenging. These limitations frequently result in on-site planning and
   manual assembly, increasing risks and inefficiencies. This study
   proposes an integrated framework that combines Building Information
   Modeling (BIM), discrete event simulation, and robotic assembly to
   optimize the installation of CLT structures within the built
   environment. By leveraging these technologies, the methodology addresses
   material handling challenges while enhancing construction efficiency and
   adaptability to urban and prefabricated settings. Numerical simulations
   and robotic assembly experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the
   framework's performance. Results demonstrate an improvement in assembly
   efficiency, reducing both accident risks and installation time compared
   to manual methods. Strong agreement between numerical and experimental
   findings underscores the potential of computational tools in advancing
   automated construction practices. This research provides actionable
   recommendations to promote the broader adoption of automated processes
   in CLT construction, contributing to safer, more efficient, and
   sustainable building practices within the evolving built environment.},

Title = {Digital twin-enabled anomaly detection for built asset monitoring in
   operation and maintenance},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Effective asset management plays a significant role in delivering the
   functionality and serviceability of buildings. However, there is a lack
   of efficient strategies and comprehensive approaches for managing assets
   and their associated data that can help to monitor, detect, record, and
   communicate operation and maintenance (O\&M) issues. With the importance
   of Digital Twin (DT) concepts being proven in the architecture,
   engineering, construction and facility management (AEC/FM) sectors, a
   DT-enabled anomaly detection system for asset monitoring and its data
   integration method based on extended industry foundation classes (IFC)
   in daily O\&M management are provided in this study. This paper presents
   a novel IFC-based data structure, using which a set of monitoring data
   that carries diagnostic information on the operational condition of
   assets is extracted from building DTs. Considering that assets run under
   changing loads determined by human demands, a Bayesian change point
   detection methodology that handles the contextual features of
   operational data is adopted to identify and filter contextual anomalies
   through cross-referencing with external operation information. Using the
   centrifugal pumps in the heating, ventilation and air-cooling (HVAC)
   system as a case study, the results indicate and prove that the novel
   DT-based anomaly detection process flow realizes a continuous anomaly
   detection of pumps, which contributes to efficient and automated asset
   monitoring in O\&M.},

Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {168},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The accurate assessment and effective management of deep excavation risk
   have faced longstanding challenges due to the highly complicated and
   uncertain construction process. A digital twin, designed with the
   datamechanism-fused (DMF) physical and virtual models, is developed to
   solve problems by integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM), data
   mining (DM), and physical mechanisms. In the DMF physical model, a
   mechanical model is embedded into the digital twin to implement
   real-time interaction and inversion between fieldmeasured and simulated
   data, thus revealing the evolution law of mechanical properties and
   creating a multisource DMF database. In the virtual model, the random
   forest (RF) regression is applied to fully learn the multisource
   database and accurately predict retaining wall behaviors on behalf of
   excavation risk. The proposed digital twin facilitates practical
   applications to imitate physical construction process, predict
   excavation-induced behavior, and realize closed-loop risk management
   with a high degree of automation, intelligence, and reliability.},

Title = {AN ONTOLOGY-BASED COST ESTIMATION FOR OFFSITE CONSTRUCTION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {220-245},
Abstract = {Design for manufacturing and assembly (DfMA) has been widely applied to
   support the decision -making process in offsite construction. With a
   DfMA approach, cost estimation requires taking product design and
   production processes into consideration. Current studies conduct cost
   estimation built upon quantity take-offs. However, they do not provide a
   vocabulary to relate cost estimates to offsite construction processes.
   This paper presents a new domain ontology, Offsite Housing Ontology
   (OHO) using the NeOn methodology framework to support cost estimation
   considering products, resources, and production processes. OHO
   semantically defines offsite construction domain terminology and
   relationships. This supports a unified model, required for efficient
   collaborative design management. The efficiency and effectiveness of the
   OHO approach are demonstrated in a real-world DfMA scenario through the
   development of a Knowledge-Based Engineering tool to automate cost
   estimation. The approach can be adapted and extended to accommodate a
   very wide range of offsite housing, delivering important optimization
   and automation benefit from DfMA solutions.},

Abstract = {PurposeBuilt asset management processes require a long transition period
   to collect, edit and update asset conditions information from existing
   data sets. This paper aims to explore and explain whether and how
   digital technologies, including asset information model (AIM), Internet
   of Things (IoT) and blockchain, can enhance asset conditions assessment
   and lead to better asset management.Design/methodology/approachMixed
   methods are applied to achieve the research objective with a focus in
   universities. The questionnaire aims to test whether the integration of
   AIM, IoT and blockchain can enhance asset condition assessment (ACA).
   Descriptive statistical analysis was applied to the quantitative data.
   The mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, skewness and range
   of the data group were calculated. Semi-structured interviews were
   designed to answer how the integration of AIM, IoT and blockchain can
   enhance the ACA. Quantitative data was analysed to define and explain
   the essential factors for each sub-hypothesis. Meanwhile, to strengthen
   the evaluation of the research hypothesis, the researcher also obtained
   secondary data from the literature review.FindingsThe research shows
   that the integration of AIM, IoT and blockchain strongly influences
   asset conditions assessment. The integration of AIM, IoT and blockchain
   can improve the asset monitoring and diagnostics through its life cycle
   and in different aspects, including financial, physical, functional and
   sustainability. Moreover, the integration of AIM, IoT and blockchain can
   enhance cross-functional collaboration to avoid misunderstandings,
   various barriers and enhance trust, communication and collaboration
   between the team members. Finally, costs and risk could be reduced, and
   performance could be increased during the ACA.Practical implicationsThe
   contribution of this study indicated that the integration of AIM, IoT
   and blockchain application in asset assessment could increase the
   efficiency, accuracy, stability and flexibility of asset assessment to
   ensure the reliability of assets and lead to a high-efficiency working
   environment. More importantly, a key performance indicator for ACA based

Title = {Visualised inspection system for monitoring environmental anomalies

Abstract = {Purpose Visual inspection and human judgement form the cornerstone of
   daily operations and maintenance (O\&M) services activities carried out
   by facility managers nowadays. Recent advances in technologies such as
   building information modelling (BIM), distributed sensor networks,
   augmented reality (AR) technologies and digital twins present an immense
   opportunity to radically improve the way daily O\&M is conducted. This
   paper aims to describe the development of an AR-supported automated
   environmental anomaly detection and fault isolation method to assist
   facility managers in addressing problems that affect building occupants'
   thermal comfort. Design/methodology/approach The developed system
   focusses on the detection of environmental anomalies related to the
   thermal comfort of occupants within a building. The performance of three
   anomaly detection algorithms in terms of their ability to detect indoor
   temperature anomalies is compared. Based on the fault tree analysis
   (FTA), a decision-making tree is developed to assist facility management
   (FM) professionals in identifying corresponding failed assets according
   to the detected anomalous symptoms. The AR system facilitates easy
   maintenance by highlighting the failed assets hidden behind
   walls/ceilings on site to the maintenance personnel. The system can thus
   provide enhanced support to facility managers in their daily O\&M
   activities such as inspection, recording, communication and
   verification. Findings Taking the indoor temperature inspection as an
   example, the case study demonstrates that the O\&M management process
   can be improved using the proposed AR-enhanced inspection system.
   Comparative analysis of different anomaly detection algorithms reveals
   that the binary segmentation-based change point detection is effective
   and efficient in identifying temperature anomalies. The decision-making
   tree supported by FTA helps formalise the linkage between temperature
   issues and the corresponding failed assets. Finally, the AR-based model
   enhanced the maintenance process by visualising and highlighting the
   hidden failed assets to the maintenance personnel on site.
   Originality/value The originality lies in bringing together the advances
   in augmented reality, digital twins and data-driven decision-making to
   support the daily O\&M management activities. In particular, the paper
   presents a novel binary segmentation-based change point detection for
   identifying temperature anomalous symptoms, a decision-making tree for
   matching the symptoms to the failed assets, and an AR system for
   visualising those assets with related information.},

Abstract = {A responsible use of energy resources is currently more important than
   ever. For the effective insulation of industrial plants, a three-camera
   measurement system was, therefore, developed. With this system, the
   as-built geometry of pipelines can be captured, which is the basis for
   the production of a precisely fitting and effective insulation. In
   addition, the digital twin can also be used for Building Information
   Modelling, e.g. for planning purposes or maintenance work. In contrast
   to the classical approach of processing the images by calculating a
   point cloud, the reconstruction is performed directly on the basis of
   the object edges in the image. For the optimisation of the, initially
   purely geometrically calculated components, an adjustment approach is
   used. In addition to the image information, this approach takes into
   account standardised parameters (such as the diameter) as well as the
   positional relationships between the components and thus eliminates
   discontinuities at the transitions. Furthermore, different automation
   approaches were developed to facilitate the evaluation of the images and
   the manual object recognition in the images for the user. For straight
   pipes, the selection of the object edges in one image is sufficient in
   most cases to calculate the 3D cylinder. Based on the normalised
   diameter, the missing depth can be derived approximately. Elbows can be
   localised on the basis of coplanar neighbouring elements. The other
   elbow parameters can be determined by matching the back projection with
   the image edges. The same applies to flanges. For merging multiple
   viewpoints, a transformation approach is used which works with
   homologous components instead of control points and minimises the
   orthogonal distances between the component axes in the datasets.},

Title = {Integrated BIM and VR for Interactive Aerodynamic Design and Wind
   Comfort Analysis of Modular Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Modular building is becoming a common sight due to government policies
   promoting greater automation and productivity. When moving towards
   modularity, indoor comfort within volumetric modules, such as levels of
   humidity and temperature, natural ventilation, and air pollutant
   transport, have a major effect on human health and well-being.
   Computational fluid dynamics simulations (CFD) are used to evaluate the
   efficiency of natural ventilation. However, designers usually find it
   difficult to visualize the CFD simulation results, which can deepen
   users' understanding of the wind environment and help optimize the
   design of modular buildings. To overcome this challenge, this paper
   presents an integrated approach based on building information modeling
   (BIM) and virtual reality (VR), with the aim of analyzing the
   aerodynamic design and wind comfort for modular buildings. The framework
   consists of four salient components. First, a new method, combining
   OpenStreetMap and Dynamo, is proposed to achieve rapid urban modeling of
   modular buildings. The second step involves the use of CFD to simulate
   the outdoor wind environment surrounding modular buildings. The third
   step emphasizes the integration of CFD-computed data with VR
   applications to create an immersive virtual environment for designers to
   analyze the wind environment of design alternates. Finally, the visual
   experience of non-professional users is used to improve the ventilation
   of the building and support more informed decision marking at the early
   stage of building design. The proposed framework is illustrated via a
   case study that focuses on a group of modular housings in the urban area
   of Singapore. The results indicate that visualization of CFD simulations
   in VR provides designers with more details regarding the actual space,
   and it is expected to help optimize the architectural design.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the relevant research activities that are being
   carried out on the development of a novel shotcrete technology capable
   of applying, autonomously and in real time, fibre reinforced shotcrete
   (FRS) with tailored properties regarding the optimum structural
   strengthening of railway tunnels (RT). This technique allows to apply
   fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) of strain softening (SSFRC) and strain
   hardening (SHFRC) according to a multi -level advanced numerical
   simulation that considers the relevant nonlinear features of these FRC,
   as well as their interaction with the surrounding soil, for an intended
   strengthening performance of the RT. Building information modelling
   (BIM) is used for assisting on the development of data files of the
   involved design software, integrating geometric assessment of a RT,
   damages from inspection and diagnosis, and the characteristics of the
   FRS strengthening solution. A dedicated computational tool was developed
   to design FRC with target properties. The preliminary experimental
   results on the evaluation of the relevant mechanical properties of the
   FRS are presented and discussed, as well as the experimental tests on
   the bond between FRS and current substrates found in RT. Representative
   numerical simulations were performed to demonstrate the structural
   performance of the proposed FRS -based strengthening technique.
   Computational tools capable of assuring, in real time, the aimed
   thickness of the layers forming the FRS strengthening shell were also
   developed. The first generation of a mechanical device for controlling
   the amount of fibres to be added, in real time, to the FRS mixture was
   conceived, built and tested. A mechanism is also being developed to
   improve the fibre distribution during its introduction through the
   mechanical device to avoid fibre balling. This work describes the
   relevant achievements already attained, as introduces the planned future
   initiatives in the scope of this project.},

Title = {Quantifying the Impact of Technology Utilization on Schedule and Cost
   Performance in Construction Projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {There has been a plethora of research on the performance of schedule and
   cost in construction projects. However, current research falls short in
   investigating the combined contribution of different construction
   technologies on project performance metrics. Specifically, none of the
   previous efforts have used integrated earned value management (EVM)
   parameters and utilized construction technologies to assess project
   schedule and cost performance. This paper fills this knowledge gap. To
   this end, a multistep research methodology was employed to (1) explore
   the utilization ratings of 13 construction technologies based on data
   collected from 52 industry experts; (2) rank these technologies in terms
   of their contribution to schedule and cost savings; (3) map the
   utilization ratings of construction technologies to schedule and cost
   variances by leveraging data from 48 construction projects with varying
   levels and scopes of technology integration to gauge the impact of using
   these technologies; and (4) develop an associated decision-support model
   that underwent rigorous verification under extreme conditions and
   sensitivity analysis. This study makes a noteworthy contribution to the
   existing body knowledge, revealing that the major drivers for schedule
   savings are building information modeling (BIM), unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs), and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), while additive
   manufacturing (AM), digital twin (DT), and Internet of Things (IoT) are
   the most significant contributors to cost savings. Moreover, the study
   reveals strong correlations between various technologies, such as UAVs
   and laser scanning, geographic information system (GIS) and GPS, AR/VR
   and digital twins, as well as robotics/automation and AR/VR.
   Furthermore, the study introduces a novel model that enhances the
   prediction of project performance, specifically in terms of schedule and
   cost variations resulting from the adoption of various construction
   technologies. Eventually, it improves the decision-making process
   related to the deployment of the investigated construction technologies.},

Title = {A scientometric review of construction progress monitoring studies},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {9},
Pages = {3237-3266},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {Purpose This article aims to explore valuable insights into the
   construction progress monitoring (CPM) research domain, which include
   main research topics, knowledge gaps and future research themes. For a
   long time, CPM has been significantly researched with increasing
   enthusiasm. Although a few review studies have been carried out, there
   is non-existence of a quantitative review study that can deliver a
   holistic picture of CPM. Design/methodology/approach The science
   mapping-based scientometric analysis was systematically processed with
   1,835 CPM-related journal articles retrieved from Scopus. The
   co-authorship analysis and direct citation analysis were carried out to
   identify the most influential researchers, countries and publishers of
   the knowledge domain. The co-occurrence analysis of keyword was assessed
   to reveal the most dominating research topics and research trend with
   the visual representation of the considered research domain. Findings
   This study reveals seven clusters of main research topics from the
   keyword co-occurrence analysis. The evolution of research confirms that
   CPM-related research studies were mainly focused on fundamental and
   traditional CPM research topics before 2007. The period between 2007 and
   2020 has seen a shift of research efforts towards digitalization and
   automation. The result suggests Building Information Modelling (BIM) as
   the most common, growing and influential research topic in the CPM
   research domain. It has been used in combination with different data
   acquisition technologies (e.g. photogrammetry, videogrammetry, laser
   scanning, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors) and data analytics
   approaches (e.g. machine learning and computer vision). Practical
   implications This study provides the horizon of potential research in
   the research domain of CPM to researchers, policymakers and
   practitioners by availing of main research themes, current knowledge
   gaps and future research directions. Originality/value This paper
   represents the first scientometric study depicting the state-of-the-art
   of the research by assessing the current knowledge domain of CPM.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe integration of technology into facilities management is
   essential for the seamless operation of organisations, encompassing a
   diverse range of activities that support the functionality, safety and
   sustainability of built environments. Thus, technology in facilities
   management has transformed the way organisations operate, enhancing
   efficiency, sustainability and user experience. This study examined the
   adoption of information technology (IT) for the successful
   implementation of facilities management (FM) systems in public
   institutions in Ghana using the technology acceptance model
   (TAM).Design/methodology/approachThe study employed a survey design
   involving 100 facilities management practitioners from public
   institutions within the Greater Accra Region.FindingsThe perceived ease
   of use of the system was significantly influenced positively by the
   availability of IT system and usability of FM system; similarly,
   perceived usefulness was found to be significantly influenced positively
   by the security and functionality of FM system. Acceptance and use of FM
   system by facilities management practitioners was also found to be
   significantly influenced positively by perceived ease of use and
   perceived usefulness of FM system.Research limitations/implicationsThe
   findings challenge managers and researchers to acknowledge that the
   availability IT resources, confidentiality and security, usability and
   functionality are very critical factors that influence facility
   management professionals' intention to adopt IT for their work.
   Facilities managers must consider automating IT systems for innovative
   and smart FM services.Originality/valueThe paper establishes the
   elements that influence FM practitioners in organisations to adopt IT in
   executing their functions.},

Title = {Framework for Computerizing the Processes of a Job and Automating the
   Operational Management on Site-A Case Study of Demolition and
   Reconstruction Construction Site},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {With regard to the topic of digitization for operational site control,
   it is clear that while there is an acceleration towards digitization of
   processes, especially complex ones, there are still clear research gaps
   to be filled. The present study is part of this line of research and
   aims to respond to the current demand for digital and sustainable
   innovation of production processes. It, therefore, aims at defining a
   framework for the management of an order that takes place in real time.
   In order to improve the quality of information and organizational
   processes of an order in a project-oriented logic, a framework has been
   created: Model Smart Management. The framework integrates project
   management techniques with digital innovation tools and includes a
   computerized procedure to monitor and control the operational management
   of the site: SmartApp. In order to allow the interoperability of
   information, the platform can be used entirely in the cloud. From the
   processing of data in the planning phase, ad hoc checklists are
   developed that include a series of activities closely related to each
   other to ensure a continuity step by step, allowing users to have an
   immediate control of the project and of the relevant key performance
   indicators thanks to an advanced and fully customizable reporting.
   SmartApp, integrated with a cloud computing system, makes computerized
   and automated the operational control on site, creating a centralized
   archive of all company data, reducing time and costs for the management
   of documentation. Moreover, with the omnichannel system, paper documents
   are managed and archived through QR-code, optical character recognition
   on smart devices, so as to achieve a regime of maximum efficiency. This
   framework was then applied in a case study located in L'Aquila, Italy,
   represented by a post 2009 earthquake demolition and reconstruction
   site.},

Title = {Removal of occluding construction workers in job site image data using
   U-Net based context encoders},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the field of Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facility
   Management (AEC/FM), job site surveying is critical for tasks such as
   construction progress monitoring and quality assurance and quality
   control. Moving obstacles often occlude the sight of view, and sometimes
   block the view of interest. However, images are often collected for
   documentation and analysis of the building under construction or
   operation. The occluding objects, such as the construction workers,
   compromise the collected image data. On the other hand, the capability
   of the Context Encoders model took the pioneering step providing the
   opportunity of image inpainting. This research applies Context Encoders
   to remove redundant objects in images and inpaints the background
   context. The original Context Encoders model, a deep learning model,
   requires a large training dataset for a decent image inpainting. In the
   model, the region in need of context inpainting is constrained to be a
   predefined area, fixed in size and position in the image. In this work,
   we adapted a deep learning architecture, U-Net, for a direct image
   -to-image translation for context inpainting, and thus relaxing the
   fixed size and position constraints in the original Context Encoders
   model. Simultaneously in a single framework, the proposed model not only
   erases redundant objects but also inpaints the missing content in the
   pixel scale, based on surrounding semantic clues. Employing the U-Net
   yields encouraging results for cases in operating buildings and those
   under construction.},

Title = {Exploring Alternative Revenue Models for Construction Consulting Firms
   in the Digital Era},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The AEC industry, including construction consulting, is experiencing
   digitalization through technologies like Building Information Modeling
   (BIM), impacting firms' business models. The traditional hourly-based
   model does not align with shortened project timelines driven by
   digitalization, design automation, and product-based approaches. This
   study uses a case study approach and explores and evaluates four
   selected alternative revenue models (freemium, subscription,
   out-come-based, and performance-based) for value creation using a
   digital tool developed by the consulting firm. The freemium model
   enhances market reach but requires a high conversion rate. The
   subscription model offers steady recurring revenue and supports client
   relationships. Out-come-based and performance-based models link payments
   to client outcomes and performance metrics, fostering efficiency and
   competitive advantages. The study identified multiple target markets for
   this tool and emphasized the importance of a portfolio revenue model to
   meet specific client needs in the digital era. Implementing alternative
   revenue models aids return on investments and avoids the digitalization
   paradox. Construction consulting firms must adeptly manage these models'
   complexities to address diverse client needs and leverage digital
   transformation opportunities.},

Title = {The management of bridge structures - challenges and possibilities},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {68},
Number = {2},
Pages = {5-35},
Abstract = {Bridges are particularly vulnerable elements of transport
   infrastructures. In many cases, bridge structures may be subject to
   higher volumes of traffic and higher loads as well as more severe
   environmental conditions than it was designed. Sound procedures to
   ensure monitoring, quality control, and preventive maintenance systems
   are therefore vital. The paper presents main challenges and arriving
   possibilities in management of bridge structures, including:
   relationships between environment and bridge infrastructure, improvement
   of diagnostic technologies, advanced modelling of bridges in
   computer-based management systems, development of knowledge-based expert
   systems with application of artificial intelligence, applications of
   technology of Bridge Information Modelling (BrIM) with augmented and
   virtual reality techniques. Presented activities are focused on
   monitoring the safety of bridges for lowering the risk of an unexpected
   collapse significantly as well as on efficient maintenance of bridges as
   components of transport infrastructure - by means of integrated
   management systems. The proposed classification of Bridge Management
   Systems shows the history of creating such systems and indicates the
   expected directions of their development, taking into account changing
   challenges and integrating new developing technologies, including
   automation of decision-making processes.},

Title = {The role of IoT sensor in smart building context for indoor fire hazard
   scenario: A systematic review of interdisciplinary articles},
Journal = {INTERNET OF THINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been growing interest in using Internet of
   Things (IoT) sensors to address indoor fire hazards in smart buildings.
   This study conducted a systematic review of 54 articles from
   interdisciplinary databases using selected keywords over the past
   decade, with the aim of investigating the potential role of IoT sensors
   in indoor fire hazard contingency. Through thematic analysis, five main
   themes and 24 sub-themes were identified, including vision-based
   sensing, smart automation, evacuation and indoor navigation, early fire
   detection, intervention and prevention, and BIM-related. The results of
   this review indicate that there are numerous aspects of indoor fire
   hazards that could benefit from the use of IoT sensors, and that the
   recurrence of technical terminologies in the analysed articles
   underscores the importance of these technologies in establishing an IoT
   sensor network in smart building environments, particularly in
   addressing indoor fire incidents. The outcome and findings spurred a
   concept for potential future research ideas. As a result of the
   findings, a conceptual framework for IoT sensors in the context of smart
   buildings is proposed.},

Title = {Digital Transformation of Building Permits: Current Status, Maturity,
   and Future Prospects},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Building permits ensure construction meets codes and regulations, but
   the traditional permitting process is often complex and inefficient.
   This perspective paper examines the current state and maturity of
   digitizing and automating building permits. We studied current permit
   workflows and the recent literature to identify digitization
   opportunities like online portals, automated code-checking, and data
   integration. Most jurisdictions are only in the early digital stages,
   focused on implementing electronic document management and online
   portals. Some leading cities have piloted more advanced capabilities
   like automated code compliance checking, but widespread adoption lags.
   The greatest challenges exist around fragmented IT environments, data
   integration, organizational inertia, and failing to adapt to
   technological advancements, such as the example of AI. Achieving higher
   digital permitting processes requires optimized data sharing, instant
   feedback loops, and automation-enabled plan reviews. While pockets of
   innovation exist, mainstream adoption lags behind visionary potential.
   Realizing the future permitting paradigm demands open data standards,
   configurable software infrastructure, and organizational commitment to
   digitize end-to-end. This paper presents regulators and innovators with
   a perspective framework to evolve permitting towards smarter, faster,
   and more integrated digital systems and strategies.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {8},
Pages = {3181-3209},
Month = {AUG 16},
Abstract = {Purpose With interest in modern construction methods and new
   technologies on the rise, construction companies globally are
   increasingly looking at how to embrace new ideas and engage with new
   approaches to do things better. A significant amount of work has been
   carried out investigating the use of individual technologies in the
   construction sector. However, there is no holistic understanding of the
   new and emerging technologies that have had proven benefits for
   construction projects. To fill this gap, this paper aims to provide a
   landscape of technologies that have been implemented in the construction
   industry and the benefits associated with their implementation.
   Design/methodology/approach A systematic review approach and PRISMA
   guidelines were used. A total of 175 articles published between 2001 and
   2020 were identified and thoroughly reviewed. Findings The results show
   that a total of 26 technologies were identified from the literature, and
   these can be categorised into five groups in terms of their
   functionality in construction process, namely: (1) data acquisition, (2)
   analytics, (3) visualisation, (4) communication and (5) design and
   construction automation. Digital technologies, especially for data
   acquisition and visualisation, generally appear to underpin and enable
   innovation in many aspects of construction. Improvements in work
   efficiency, health and safety, productivity, quality and sustainability
   have been cited as being the primary benefits of using these
   technologies. Of these, building information modelling (BIM) appears to
   be the single most commonly used technology thus far. With the
   development of computer technology, BIM has constantly been used in
   combination with other technologies/tools such as unmanned aerial
   vehicles/systems (unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)/UAS), geographic
   information systems (GIS), light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and
   multidimensional modelling to realise a specifically defined benefit.
   Practical implications The findings from this review would help
   construction practitioners identify the types of technologies that can
   be implemented in different stages of construction projects to achieve
   desired outcomes, and thus, make appropriate decisions on technology
   investment and adoption. This review also suggests that to reap the full
   potential that these technologies offer, aside from construction
   companies changing their culture and business models, corresponding
   changes in the construction sector's operating systems related to
   building regulation, education and training, as well as contracting and
   procurement are required. Originality/value This paper undertakes a
   comprehensive systematic review of studies on technology implementation
   in the construction sector published between 2001 and 2020. It is the
   first attempt internationally to provide a holistic picture of
   technologies that have been studied and implemented in construction
   projects.},

Title = {Virtual reality applications for the built environment: Research trends
   and opportunities},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With its advanced capabilities of immersive and interactive
   visualization, virtual reality (VR) has been advocated to facilitate
   design, engineering, construction, and management for the built
   environment. Substantial efforts have thus been devoted to VR-related
   applications in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
   industry over the last decades, resulting in a vast, diverse, and
   fragmented body of knowledge. The objective of this research is to
   systematically gain an in-depth understanding of research trends as well
   as reveal challenges and opportunities for future research in the area.
   To achieve this objective, this research explores the state-of-the-art
   in VR applications for the built environment by a mixed
   quantitative-qualitative review method. A total of 229 journal articles
   are collected using a structured data acquisition approach from Scopus
   and then fed into a bibliometric analysis to construct science maps. By
   doing so, the main research outlets, articles, and themes of this
   research field are quantitatively identified. Subsequently, an in-depth
   qualitative discussion is presented to provide deeper insights into the
   challenges and opportunities of main research topics. Furthermore,
   future research directions are proposed as follows: 1) user-centered
   adaptive design, 2) attention-driven virtual reality information
   systems, 3) construction training systems incorporating human factors,
   4) occupant-centered facility management, and 5) industry adoption. This
   research contributes to the body of knowledge by synthesizing the state
   of the art of VR technology for the built environment and exposing its
   research needs, which can serve both academia and industry in terms of
   promoting VR applications for the built environment.},

Title = {Using image analysis to quantify defects and prioritize repairs in
   built-up roofs},
Journal = {FACILITIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 2},
Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
   provide an objective approach to classify deteriorated building assets
   according to the type and extent of damage. This research supports
   automated inspection of buildings and focuses on roofing elements as one
   of the most critical and externally distressed elements in buildings.
   Design/methodology/approachIn this paper, 5,000+ images of deteriorated
   roofs from several buildings were collected to design a CNN system that
   automatically identifies and sizes roofing defects. Experimenting with
   different CNN formulations, the best accuracy is achieved using
   two-stage CNNs. The first-stage CNN classifies images into defect/no
   defect, while the second stage classifies the defected images according
   to the damage type. Based on the image classification, optimization is
   used to prioritize roof repairs by maximizing the return from limited
   rehabilitation funds. FindingsThe developed CNNs reached 95\% and 97\%
   accuracy for the first and second phases, respectively, which is higher
   than achieved in previous literature efforts. Using the proposed model
   to automate inspection and condition assessment activities proved to be
   faster than conventional methods. Repair/replace strategy for a case
   study of 21 campus buildings based on their condition and budgetary
   constraints was suggested. Research limitations/implicationsFuture
   research includes testing different data acquisition technologies (e.g.
   infrared imaging), performing severity-based classification and
   integrating with BIM for defect localization. Originality/valueThis
   study provides an objective approach to automate asset condition
   assessment and improve funding decisions using a combination of image
   analysis and optimization techniques. The proposed approach is
   applicable toward other asset types and components.},

   USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HEURISTIC TECHNIQUES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {173-190},
Abstract = {Infrastructure systems in the United States are aging and considerable
   investment is needed to renew and replace a significant proportion of
   the existing systems. Piping systems, which are used in many
   infrastructure systems such as the distribution networks for utilities -
   water, sewage, gas, oil, etc., are very important in this regard. Real
   time scheduling is an important and necessary task in the planning and
   execution of construction projects. This is of particular importance in
   the installation of pipe systems, for which it is time consuming to plan
   and coordinate between team members the detailed requirements and
   information for the generation of practical installation schedules.
   During the installation stage, there can be delays or interference that
   could lead to the failure of the initial schedule plan. Current
   approaches are time-consuming, not automated and do not provide
   real-time schedules. Thus, the process is still fragmented and
   essentially manual, with inefficient information flow. To effectively
   improve the installation schedule, current knowledge of the installation
   site situation is important, with this knowledge being used to generate
   realistic schedules. Artificial intelligence (AI) maximizes the value of
   data by learning from previous cases and facilitates decision-making by
   making the process smarter and automatic. This paper proposes a new AI
   framework with machine learning (ML) and heuristic optimization
   techniques for automating practical pipe system installation schedule
   generation and optimization. A BIM model is used as reference to provide
   pipe system component information. A hybrid knowledge-based system is
   developed to integrate data-driven knowledge base and site-driven
   knowledge base on pipe system installation. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and
   Graph Neural Network (GNN) ML techniques are adapted to map extracted
   components with the installation activities and their requirements for
   installation based on knowledge obtained from industry experts and
   piping codes. In addition, a heuristic algorithm is adopted to optimize
   the installation schedule. Finally, an optimal installation schedule
   that minimizes overlapping activities, time and cost is suggested.},

Title = {Enhancing the Manufacturing Process in Light-Gauge Steel Off-Site
   Construction Using Semiautomation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {151},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {This study introduces a digitalized workflow for light-gauge steel
   off-site construction projects to reduce task duration, enhance data
   flow, and improve project cost assessment. With technological
   advancements, digitalization and building information modeling have
   become crucial in off-site construction to boost productivity. This
   research systematically integrates these technologies within the
   off-site construction framework, aiming to decrease manufacturing
   duration and enhance the accuracy of the bill of quantities for cost
   assessment during the manufacturing phase. The study addresses the
   knowledge and practice gap by presenting a comprehensive workflow
   tailored for light-gauge steel off-site construction projects. The study
   employs a design science research approach to develop the proposed
   workflow. The primary objectives are to assess whether a digitalized
   workflow can significantly reduce task duration and improve project cost
   assessment and to evaluate the financial feasibility of semiautomation
   in light-gauge steel off-site construction projects. A real modular
   project with 47 modules and a total gross floor area of 2,500 m2 is used
   to apply and evaluate the workflow. The effectiveness of the workflow is
   assessed by comparing task durations and bill of quantities accuracy
   before and after implementation. The economic feasibility is evaluated
   through a cost-benefit analysis referencing the case project. Three
   months of data postimplementation show a 66.67\% reduction in task
   duration and a 45.39\% improvement in bill of quantities accuracy. On
   average, the workflow resulted in a 38.11\% reduction in production and
   assembly duration and a 10.77\% improvement in measurement accuracy. The
   cost-benefit analysis indicates a payback period of 10 months and 26
   days for the initial investment. The results are validated within the
   Canadian construction industry context. This paper focuses on the design
   and manufacturing phases, suggesting further studies should cover the
   installation and operation stages.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Globally, different approaches have been applied to improve workplace
   safety practices due to the complexities of construction activities that
   pose different dangers to workers' safety and wellbeing. This study uses
   Lagos, Nigeria, as a case study and investigates awareness of 4IR
   technologies in H \& S practices among construction professionals in the
   Nigerian construction industry. A quantitative research approach was
   developed to retrieve a structured survey questionnaire from
   construction stakeholders in the study area. Retrieved data was analysed
   in three stages: data reliability and validity, descriptive statistics,
   and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The descriptive analysis findings
   and the Kruskal-Wallis H test revealed no significant difference in
   professionals' awareness of 4IR technologies in H \& S practices in the
   construction project delivery in Lagos, Nigeria. The findings of the EFA
   returned four-factor components of H \& S practices enabling
   technologies in the Era of 4IR as data and robotic technologies,
   process-based automation, output communication technologies, and
   wearable hazard detectives' technologies. This study recommends
   innovative strategies from the professional bodies through academic and
   professional development (workshops, training, conferences, and
   seminars) to improve knowledge of 4IR technologies in H \& S practices

Title = {Employing non-contact sensing techniques for improving efficiency and
   automation in numerical modelling of existing masonry structures: A
   critical literature review},
Journal = {STRUCTURES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {1777-1797},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper presents approaches for the employment of non-contact sensing
   to enhance both the efficiency and reliability of numerical modelling of
   historic masonry. It commences with a thorough review of the high-level
   numerical modelling approaches of historic masonry. Following, the
   accuracy and cost-effectivity of available non-contact sensing
   techniques are reviewed for surveying masonry structures. These are: a)
   the total station; b) the laser tracker; c) Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
   photogrammetry; and d) terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Then,
   strategies of automatically developing geometric models (i.e., numerical
   models before structural analysis) from geospatial data are reviewed,
   considering their potential for automation and usage. These were based
   on the employment of: a) point clouds; b) meshes; c) non-uniform
   rational basis splines (NURBSs); d) building information models (BIMs);
   e) orthoimages; and f) discrete points. Primarily, the review found that
   high-level numerical modelling approaches such as the continuum and
   block-based models are highly effective, but necessitate accurate
   geometric data for reliable results. To bridge this gap, the potential
   of emerging technologies such as SfM photogrammetry was found to
   significantly improve the efficiency and robustness of high-level
   structural analysis, through providing geometric data accurately and
   with a low cost. Moreover, the cloud-based (i.e., with a point cloud)
   and image-based (i.e., with an orthoimage) approaches of converting
   geospatial data into numerical models were also found the most
   effective, for continuum and block-based modelling respectively. This
   contribution demonstrates the potential to employ novel digital
   technologies such as noncontact sensing techniques to improve the
   efficiency and robustness of high-level numerical modelling approaches.},

Title = {Roles of artificial intelligence in construction engineering and
   management: A critical review and future trends},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {122},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With the extensive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI),
   construction engineering and management (CEM) is experiencing a rapid
   digital transformation. Since AI-based solutions in CEM has become the
   current research focus, it needs to be comprehensively understood. In
   this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both
   scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of
   AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research
   trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore
   the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473
   journal articles published in 1997-2020. It is found that there has been
   an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along
   with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building
   information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief
   understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the
   emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high
   efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have
   been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in
   CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2)
   information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language
   processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The
   goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a
   data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex
   project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key
   directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual
   and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things
   (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to
   constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM.},

Title = {Multi crane lift simulation using Building Information Modeling},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {118},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Developing heavy-lift studies is a vital task in heavy congested
   industrial projects such as modular projects where it is necessary to
   lift modules with mobile cranes. However, preparing these lift studies
   can be timeconsuming. Hence, automating this process is a great step in
   saving time, and reducing the percentage of errors, having the
   practitioner focus on lift planning rather than tedious tasks. A
   significant step in the pre-construction and construction phase of an
   industrial project is creating the 4D animation of lift processes. Such
   an animation develops a better understanding of the process and
   streamlines finding the best path for the mobile crane movements to
   avoid collisions. Such a 4D lift animation (i.e., simulation) can be a
   mandate when the lifting process is performed in a congested
   construction site involving more than one crane. This research study
   aims to propose a comprehensive framework for creating the 4D animation
   of a multi mobile crane lift process. The proposed approach can connect
   to a comprehensive model, in Building Information Modeling (BIM)
   terminologies, or can auto-generate the simplified CAD model containing
   the lifting objects (i.e., modules in modular construction) and
   obstructions by interacting with a central database. It can also
   auto-generate the 3D model of cranes in the set and pick positions.
   Then, the lift animation can be developed quickly in an automated manner
   by employing a customized Application Programming Interface (API). The
   developed API generates the lift animation of the cranes based on the
   defined timeline and lifting path by reading the required data (e.g.,
   site information, modules information, cranes information, object
   models, and lift sequences) from the database. The proposed framework is
   validated by applying in a portion of a real modular industrial project
   in Alberta, Canada. The results show that the developed system has
   enough flexibility to simulate multi-mobile crane movements with various
   types of mobile cranes, multiple kinds of movements, and various site
   conditions.},

   Sustainable Housing Delivery in Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) grapples with the challenge of
   achieving sustainable housing delivery amidst rapid urbanization and
   rising construction costs. Current housing strategies have failed to
   offer a lasting solution to the crisis. To address these issues, this
   study advocates the adoption of fourth industrial revolution (4IR)
   technologies for sustainable housing. The previous literature highlights
   the versatility of 4IR technologies, prompting an examination of their
   suitability and benefits for housing delivery. Thus, this study was
   aimed at evaluating suitable 4IR technologies for housing delivery and
   the benefits of adopting the technologies for sustainable housing
   delivery. The data used were collected via random sampling from
   stakeholders in the housing sector and analyzed using SPSS V 24,
   including mean scores, frequencies, and principal component analysis
   (PCA). The KMO and Bartlett's test of sphericity confirmed that the data
   were appropriate for PCA and identified three key components of 4IR
   technology: Immersive technologies, smart connectivity, and automated
   construction sites suitable for sustainable housing delivery. These
   components enhance decision-making, operational efficiency, and project
   management throughout the housing delivery process. The study emphasizes
   the potential of 4IR technologies to transform the housing sector in the
   KSA sustainably, offering insights for both practice and research.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence in the AEC industry: Scientometric analysis and
   visualization of research activities},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {112},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is fraught
   with complex and difficult problems. Artificial intelligence (AI)
   represents a powerful tool to assist in addressing these problems.
   Therefore, over the years, researchers have been conducting research on
   AI in the AEC industry (Al-in-the-AECI). In this paper, the first
   comprehensive scientometric study appraising the state-of-the-art of
   research on Al-in-the-AECI is presented. The science mapping method was
   used to systematically and quantitatively analyze 41,827 related
   bibliographic records retrieved from Scopus. The results indicated that
   genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets, and
   machine learning have been the most widely used AI methods in AEC.
   Optimization, simulation, uncertainty, project management, and bridges
   have been the most commonly addressed topics/issues using AI
   methods/concepts. The primary value and uniqueness of this study lies in
   it being the first in providing an up-to-date inclusive, big picture of
   the literature on Al-in-the-AECI. This study adds value to the AEC
   literature through visualizing and understanding trends and patterns,
   identifying main research interests, journals, institutions, and
   countries, and how these are linked within now-available studies on
   Al-in-the-AECI. The findings bring to light the deficiencies in the
   current research and provide paths for future research, where they
   indicated that future research opportunities lie in applying robotic
   automation and convolutional neural networks to AEC problems. For the
   world of practice, the study offers a readily-available point of
   reference for practitioners, policy makers, and research and development
   (R\&D) bodies. This study therefore raises the level of awareness of AI
   and facilitates building the intellectual wealth of the AI area in the
   AEC industry.},

Title = {Opportunities and Threats of Adopting Digital Twin in Construction
   Projects: A Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is recognized as a pillar in the transition from
   traditional to digital construction, yet the risks (opportunities and
   threats) associated with its implementation have not been thoroughly
   determined in the literature. In addition, there is a scarcity of
   research relating the risks of DT implementation to DT maturity levels,
   which has hindered the optimum consideration of such risks when DT is
   adopted at different maturity levels. To address these gaps, this study
   conducted a literature review of 1889 documents from Scopus and Web of
   Science databases. After rigorous filtration, 72 documents were selected
   and comprehensively reviewed. A total of 47 risk factors (RFs) were
   identified and categorized into opportunities (economic, technical,
   environmental and sustainability, monitoring and safety, and management)
   and threats (economic, technical, and policy and management).
   Subsequently, these RFs were mapped onto the five-level DT maturity
   model, providing users with insights into opportunities and threats on
   each level. The exhaustive list of RFs and proposed integration of a DT
   maturity model with corresponding RFs enables stakeholders to identify
   the risks in their specific use cases and facilitate the decision-making
   and success in transition across various levels of DT in real-life
   construction projects.},

   AREA LOT OF AN EXCAVATOR FOR BUILDING AN INFORMATION MODEL},
Journal = {RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2022},
Number = {2},
Pages = {40-49},
Abstract = {Statement of the problem. The construction of information models of
   construction processes is impossible without an accurate calculation of
   the amount of work performed on a typical technological parking lot
   (gripper). The aim of the work is to automate the computational
   procedures used to calculate the amount of excavation work on a typical
   technological excavator parking lot, which is used in 4D and 5D BIM
   models.
   Results. Analytical equations are obtained for calculating the volume of
   earthworks at one technological site of an excavator, taking into
   account the technical characteristics of earthmoving machines, as well
   as the conditions of work (the category of soil according to the value
   of the internal friction angle).
   Conclusions. The analytical dependences of the volume of work on one
   typical technological site of an excavator on the technical
   characteristics and operating conditions (the category of soil) can be
   used to form procedures for automatically calculating the volume of
   work, the duration and cost of the construction of pits. The amount of
   work on a single technological gripper can be used to form, evaluate and
   select the trajectory of the excavator during the construction of the
   pit.},

Title = {Automatic region-growing system for the segmentation of large point
   clouds},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {138},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This article describes a complete unsupervised system for the
   segmentation of massive 3D point clouds. Our system bridges the missing
   components that permit to go from 99\% automation to 100\% automation
   for the construction industry. It scales up to billions of 3D points and
   targets a generic low-level grouping of planar regions usable by a wide
   range of applications. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical
   multi-level segment definition to cope with potential variations in
   high-level object definitions. The approach first leverages planar
   predominance in scenes through a normal-based region growing. Then, for
   usability and simplicity, we designed an automatic heuristic to
   determine without user supervision three RANSAC-inspired parameters.
   These are the distance threshold for the region growing, the threshold
   for the minimum number of points needed to form a valid planar region,
   and the decision criterion for adding points to a region. Our
   experiments are conducted on 3D scans of complex buildings to test the
   robustness of the ``one-click{''} method in varying scenarios. Labelled
   and instantiated point clouds from different sensors and platforms
   (depth sensor, terrestrial laser scanner, hand-held laser scanner,
   mobile mapping system), in different environments (indoor, outdoor,
   buildings) and with different objects of interests (AEC-related,
   BIM-related, navigation-related) are provided as a new extensive
   test-bench. The current implementation processes ten million points per
   minutes on a single thread CPU configuration. Moreover, the resulting
   segments are tested for the high-level task of semantic segmentation
   over 14 classes, to achieve an F1-score of 90+ averaged over all
   datasets while reducing the training phase to a fraction of state of the
   art point-based deep learning methods. We provide this baseline along
   with six new open-access datasets with 300+ million hand-labelled and
   instantiated 3D points at: https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/project/

Abstract = {As digital twins are gaining importance in various industries, research
   on their impact, use cases, and implementation in the field of
   construction is accelerating. In this study, we examine the impact of
   digital twins on building safety and security throughout their

   seventeen-month period, we present an implementation architecture for
   safety and security digital twins in buildings, explore the benefits and
   shortcomings of such a system, and discuss the learnings applicable to
   different lifecycle stages of a building. This paper contributes to the
   creation and study of a digital twin for fire safety, analyzing its
   performance using two real-world use cases and reporting the
   implementation results. Additionally, we extrapolate the learnings from
   the use phase of a facility to other lifecycle phases of buildings and

   energy modeling framework for building digital twins},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {387},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Digital twins have emerged as a promising concept for improving building
   energy efficiency, but their implementation faces challenges in
   interoperability and adaptability. This paper presents a large-scale
   field demonstration of an interoperable energy modeling framework for
   building digital twins, using ontology-based semantic models as data
   sources for automated model generation and calibration of data-driven
   component models. The study focuses on a single floor of a hospital
   building, comprising 12 conditioned zones and data from 45 measuring
   devices. Across the 45 sensors, the model achieved average mean absolute
   errors of 0.40 degrees C for temperature, 32 ppm for CO2 concentration,
   0.06 for valve position, and 0.04 for damper position predictions. These
   results demonstrate the framework's ability to generate and calibrate
   accurate and flexible building energy models with reduced effort. The
   paper also showcases the framework's practical application in exploring
   system modifications to improve indoor comfort, highlighting its
   potential for scenario analysis and decision support. The proposed
   approach significantly streamlines the process of creating and
   maintaining accurate, up-to-date energy models, offering a robust
   foundation for digital twin applications in the built environment.},

Title = {Intelligent Monitoring Platform and Application for Building Energy
   Using Information Based on Digital Twin},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With the development and popularization of the Internet of Things, big
   data, cloud computing, and other technologies, Digital twin technology
   (DTT) is increasingly applied to building operation and maintenance
   (O\&M). However, most of the research focuses on building energy
   consumption, safety, and other management, and relatively little
   research on the monitoring of building terminal energy using
   information. The information is closely related to occupants' behavior,
   such as air conditioning, lighting, shading, window status information,
   as well as personnel number and location, and it has a great impact on
   building energy consumption. Due to different occupants' behaviors, the
   level of building energy consumption varies several times or even more.
   Take an office building as an example. Based on digital twin technology,
   the framework of building energy using intelligent monitoring is
   constructed. It mainly includes four parts, namely building physical
   space, virtual twin space, predictive control simulation engine, and
   twin big data. For each part, functions are realized through building
   Information Modelling (BIM), smart sensors, and Internet of Things (IoT)
   technologies. Based on the standard framework and every function
   realization method, the DTT can used for building O\&M effectually. The
   application of building an intelligent control system based on the
   occupants' characteristics is simulated and analyzed in Designbuilder
   software 6.1.2. The results show that the digital technology application
   in building intelligent control systems can realize maximum energy
   saving for 30\%. However, the DTT in building O\&M is not widely used
   now. There is a lot of research to be completed in the future.},

Title = {Appraising the Feasibility of 3D Printing Construction in New Zealand
   Housing},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The construction industry in New Zealand is significantly impacted by
   the importance of housing, particularly as urbanisation continues to
   grow in major cities. Modern construction methods, such as offsite
   construction and building automation, evolving into digital
   manufacturing and construction in the industry, have become prominent.
   Despite the global recognition of 3D printing technology, its adoption
   in the construction industry in New Zealand is still relatively limited.
   This study aims to examine the feasibility of 3D printing construction
   in response to current market challenges, innovation, and the 2050
   net-zero carbon goal. Utilising Building Information Modelling (BIM) and
   Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approaches, this study investigated the
   environmental impacts of three housing types: 3D printing (3DP), light
   steel framed (LSF), and timber. This study used cradle-to-cradle as the
   system boundary. The results indicate that the 3DP house emits 20\%
   fewer carbon emissions than the traditional timber house and 25\% less
   than the LSF house. Additionally, the 3DP house exhibits a 19\% lower
   annual electric energy consumption than the timber house. Therefore, in
   response to the growing housing demand in New Zealand, the construction
   industry must innovate and embrace digital and advanced construction
   methods, including the adoption of 3D printing.},

Title = {Automated quantity take-off in a Norwegian road project},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Automated quantity take-off from digital models in road projects has
   many benefits. In real project settings, however, it seems rarely to
   take place. This paper investigates automated quantity take-off in a
   real-life road project and the experiences from this automation. A
   literature and a document study were performed. 48 domain models
   serialized in IFC 2 x 3 were then analyzed before 10 project members
   were interviewed. The quantity take-off was automated to harvest
   classified quantities to a specification of work. The automated quantity
   take-off was reproducible at revisions for 40\% of the cost items.
   However, the transferability of the procedures to other use cases than
   the specification of work is questionable because of the applied cost
   breakdown structure. The findings suggest three practical improvements
   for automated quantity take-off in road projects. The three include (1)
   using unambiguous classes assembled in an ontology, (2) avoiding hard
   coding of cost breakdown structures in authoring tools, and (3)
   implementing the Level of Information Need (LOIN) to improve reusability
   across project phases and use cases. The quantity take-off and
   experiences are assessed from the designer's perspective. The client's
   and contractor's perspectives were out of this paper's scope.},

Title = {Automated Quality Inspection of Formwork Systems Using 3D Point Cloud
   Data},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ensuring that formwork systems are properly installed is essential for
   construction safety and quality. They have to comply with specific
   design requirements and meet strict tolerances regarding the
   installation of the different members. The current method of quality
   control during installation mostly relies on manual measuring tools and
   inspections heavily reliant on the human factor, which could lead to
   inconsistencies and inaccurate results. This study proposes a way to
   automate the inspection process and presents a framework within which to
   measure the spacing of the different members of the formwork system
   using 3D point cloud data. 3D point cloud data are preprocessed,
   processed, and analyzed with various techniques, including filtering,
   downsampling, transforming, fitting, and clustering. The novelty is not
   only in the integration of the different techniques used but also in the
   detection and measurement of key members in the formwork system with
   limited human intervention. The proposed framework was tested on a real
   construction site. Five cases were investigated to compare the proposed
   approach to the manual and traditional one. The results indicate that
   this approach is a promising solution and could potentially be an
   effective alternative to manual inspections for quality control during
   the installation of formwork systems.},

Title = {A framework for semi-automatically identifying fully occluded objects in
   3D models: Towards comprehensive construction design review in virtual
   reality},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {50},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR)-based construction design review applications have
   shown potential to enhance user performance in many research projects
   and experiments. Currently, visualizing occluded objects in VR is a
   challenge, and this function is indispensable for construction design
   review and coordination. This paper proposes an occlusion detection
   framework that semi-automatically identifies occluded objects in 3D
   construction models. The framework determines the visibility status of
   an object by converting the object to a point cloud and comparing the
   point cloud to the virtual laser scanning result of the original model.
   It exports models that are interoperable with VR development software so
   that visualization effects can be easily employed to occluded objects.
   The authors validated the framework using two building information
   models. The algorithm achieved a recall rate of 90.30\% and a precision
   rate of 75.05\% in a gasoline refinery facility model. It reached a
   higher 98.06\% recall rate and a 97.53\% precision rate in an academic
   building model. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by
   proposing a semi-automatic occlusion detection framework and validating
   that point cloud-based algorithms are appropriate for this
   classification task.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In the digital transformation era in the Architecture, Engineering, and
   Construction (AEC) industry, Cognitive Digital Twins (CDT) are
   introduced as part of the next level of process automation and control
   towards Construction 4.0. CDT incorporates cognitive abilities to detect
   complex and unpredictable actions and reason about dynamic process
   optimization strategies to support decision-making in building lifecycle
   management (BLM). Nevertheless, there is a lack of understanding of the
   real impact of CDT integration, Machine Learning (ML), Cyber-Physical
   Systems (CPS), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of
   Things (IoT), all connected to self-learning hybrid models with
   proactive cognitive capabilities for different phases of the building
   asset lifecycle. This study investigates the applicability,
   interoperability, and integrability of an adapted model of CDT for BLM
   to identify and close this gap. Surveys of industry experts were
   performed focusing on life cycle-centric applicability,
   interoperability, and the CDT model's integration in practice besides
   decision support capabilities and AEC industry insights. The evaluation
   of the adapted model of CDT model support approaching the development of
   CDT for process optimization and decision-making purposes, as well as
   integrability enablers confirms progression towards Construction 4.0.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This review discusses new technologies in the construction industry,
   such as digitalization, automation, and robotization, which have an
   impact on improving sustainable construction in the digital
   transformation in the era of Industry 4.0. This review focuses
   specifically on the impact of robotic technology on the triad of
   sustainable construction: economy, environment, and society. Current
   trends in the construction industry related to common data environments
   (CDEs), building information modeling (BIM), construction robots (CRs),
   and bricklaying robots (BRs) are highlighted. Robotics technology used
   throughout the construction industry in a sustainable construction
   context is presented, including bricklaying, plastering, painting,
   welding, prefabrication, and material handling. New trends in robotics
   technology with respect to robotic bricklaying are presented, and the
   first mobile robotic bricklaying system (RBS) in Poland, which was
   designed, modeled, simulated, and built from scratch, is distinguished.
   The RBS was tested under laboratory conditions and verified on the
   construction site. Included are the main factors that make it impossible
   to spread robotic technology on construction sites, and furthermore,
   many solutions are proposed to problems associated with the robotic
   transformation. The discussed robotic technology is not limited only to
   a purely technical approach but takes into account challenges
   corresponding to the circular economy.},

Title = {Review on solid wastes incorporated cementitious material using 3D

Journal = {CASE STUDIES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {21},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The substitution of cement, natural sand, and synthetic fibers in
   concrete with solid wastes substantially reduces CO2 emissions.
   Incorporating solid wastes into 3D printed concrete, which reduces CO2
   emissions from labor and formwork, can achieve innovative low-carbon
   construction materials. However, the previous studies lack a
   comprehensive review on the inherent characteristics of various solid
   wastes and their impacts on the printability, mechanical performance,
   and functionality of 3D printed concrete. This paper reviews the present
   state of research and introduces feasible methods for the sustainable
   use of solid wastes in 3D printed concrete. Numerous types of solid
   wastes are investigated comprising their benefits, shortages, and fit
   dose to guide in selecting the optimal solid waste to enhance the
   performance of printed concrete. Additionally, the printability,
   functionality, and mechanical strength of printed concrete with solid
   waste addition are quantified and summarized. The preliminary
   exploration to achieve a balance between multi-functionality and
   mechanical properties using mixed solid wastes is conducted for 3D
   concrete printing. Finally, machine learning, broadening raw material
   sources, automated monitoring systems, multi-functionalized composite,
   and BIM are proposed to address current challenges.},

   Sequence of Prefabricated Building Components},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The assembly of prefabricated components is a critical process in
   prefabricated building construction, influencing both progress and
   accuracy. However, the assembly sequence planning and optimization
   (ASPO) of prefabricated components have yet to receive sufficient
   attention from researchers, and current research has displayed limited
   automation and poor generalization capabilities. Therefore, this paper
   proposes a framework for intelligently generating assembly sequences for
   prefabricated components based on graph databases and matrices. The
   framework utilizes an adjacency matrix and interference matrix-based
   modeling method to comprehensively describe the connections and
   constraint relationships between components, enabling better evaluation
   of assembly difficulty during optimization. The graph database serves as
   the central hub for data exchange, facilitating component information
   storage, automatic querying, and summarization. The obtained assembly
   sequence and progress plan are fed back into the graph database. To
   accomplish assembly sequence optimization, a genetic algorithm based on
   the double-elite strategy is employed. Furthermore, the effectiveness of
   the proposed framework is validated through an actual engineering case.
   The results demonstrate that the framework can effectively find an
   optimal assembly sequence to mitigate the assembly challenge of a
   prefabricated building.},

Title = {Concert Halls as Nearly Adaptive Spaces},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Concert halls have led to increasingly complex spaces that cannot be
   thought of as static `containers' anymore. This complexity makes them
   viable to be launched towards industry 4.0 and to be considered a
   function of the activities that they can provide during their life
   cycle. They are characterized by dynamic objects that contain
   sophisticated sub-systems and add to the capability to influence both
   environmental variables and user behavior. This article explains an
   adaptive concert hall at an early stage, in which a network of sensors
   that gather real-time data on environmental factors such as temperature,
   air humidity and air velocity are considered, focusing on their direct
   and indirect intercorrelations with the acoustic quantities to optimize
   the room acoustic response. The proposed methodology is controlled by a
   digital twin (DT) based on building information modeling (BIM),
   integrated with sensors, actuators, and acoustic measurements and
   algorithms. By analyzing the data, algorithms identify patterns, and an
   autonomous fine-tune setting is achieved, including the novelty for
   which a natural variable acoustic field becomes possible during a
   musical execution without the use of any electroacoustic system support.
   The hall becomes a natural active instrument to be included in the
   composer's score. A case study is presented.},

Title = {Deep learning-based computer vision in project management: Automating
   indoor construction progress monitoring},
Journal = {PROJECT LEADERSHIP AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Progress monitoring is crucial for effective project management,
   particularly in construction projects. The adoption of computer vision
   with deep learning expedites automation, accuracy, and efficiency in
   construction progress monitoring by overcoming the challenges of
   laborious, and error prone manual methods. While there is growing
   attention on developing computer vision based deep learning models for
   construction progress monitoring, deployment platforms for project
   managers are lacking. Using computer vision, this study develops a Mask
   Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network deep learning model. It utilizes
   progress images of drywall construction from two indoor construction
   sites and tests the model on a third indoor site in Sydney, Australia.
   The model is capable of automated as-built visual detection and
   work-in-progress measurement. The study also provides an understanding
   on the deployment process of the deep learning model on a cloud-based
   platform called Streamlit. By developing a model tailored for
   automatically quantifying work-in-progress of indoor construction
   elements and detailing the process of deploying that model on a
   cloud-based platform, this study significantly advances digitalization
   of construction project management. Project managers, stand to benefit
   from these advancements by gaining access to more accurate and automated
   construction progress monitoring for better decision-making.},

Abstract = {3D modeling of the indoor environment is essential for urban
   applications such as indoor navigation, emergency simulations, floor
   planning, and building construction. With the development of laser
   scanning sensors, 3D laser scanners can quickly obtain high-density,
   high -precision 3D coordinates and attribute information, which brings
   significant advantages in collecting 3D information on indoor scenes.
   Many studies have been published on the fast reconstruction of 3D models
   based on point cloud data obtained by various types of laser scanning
   sensors. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art automated 3D indoor
   modeling technologies. The 3D modeling standards for indoor environments
   are introduced, and data acquisition based on laser scanning sensors and
   characteristics of point clouds are discussed. Indoor object
   classification and indoor room segmentation are also examined in detail.
   The 3D indoor reconstruction methods (i.e., line-based, plane-based, and
   volume-based) are systematically introduced and the advantages and
   disadvantages of these methods are presented. Future research directions
   in this field are discussed and summarized. This review can help
   researchers improve current approaches or develop new techniques for 3D

Title = {Design information-assisted graph neural network for modeling central
   air conditioning systems},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {60},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Buildings consume huge amounts of energy to create a comfortable and
   healthy built environment for people. The building engineering industry
   has benefitted from the advances in building informatics, including the
   rich data available in modern buildings and the rapid development in
   computing technology and data science, for building energy management.
   Dynamic modeling is often essential to online control and optimization
   of building energy systems. Data-driven modeling empowered by advanced
   machine learning has achieved ground-breaking performance in capturing
   temporal relationships among multivariate building operation data in
   recent years. However, the structural relationships among the physical
   entities, e.g., the topology of air conditioning ductworks and
   terminals, are generally overlooked in existing data-driven modeling
   methods, although they are very helpful in capturing the relationships
   among building operation data. This study proposes to represent building
   air conditioning systems as graphs for machine learning, whose nodes and
   edges represent physical entities (e.g., VAV terminals) and their
   connections (e.g., ductwork), respectively. A novel graph neural
   network-based methodology is developed for dynamic modeling of central
   air conditioning systems, which consists of three steps, i.e., automated
   graph structure design, development of graph neural network, and model
   evaluation and explanation. Viable and generalizable graph structure
   design methods based on design information, e.g., design drawings and
   BIM models, and machine learning algorithms for model development and
   explanation are proposed. A case study of dynamic modeling of a real
   central air conditioning system serving the tallest building in Hong
   Kong is carried out by adopting the methodology developed. Image
   identification techniques are employed to extract the topology of the
   air conditioning system from 2D schematic drawings, which is used as the
   prototype of the graphs. Graph neural network-based models, consisting
   of a graph layer and a recurrent layer, are developed to capture the
   structural and temporal relationships, separately. The graph layer
   learns structural relationships from the input graphs by using graph
   convolutional network (GCN) and graph attention network (GAT). The
   recurrent layer learns temporal relationships from massive historical
   operation data by using LSTM. As the models become much ``darker{''},
   the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method is adopted to provide
   both global and local model explanations, i.e., the impact of each model
   input on outputs. The developed models exhibit improved capabilities of
   automated model architecture design, prediction accuracy,
   generalizability and interpretability. The methodology developed for
   dynamic modeling of air conditioning systems in this study leverages
   both traditional building system design information and powerful machine
   learning algorithms, and exemplifies an ideal synergy between
   engineering domain expertise and machine learning.},

Abstract = {Construction companies usually record customer complaints as
   unstructured texts, resulting in unsuitable information to understand
   defect occurrences. Moreover, complaint databases are often manually
   classified, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, previous
   studies have not provided guidance on how to improve customer complaint
   data collection and analysis. This research aims to devise an
   information management model for customer complaints in residential
   projects. Using Design Science Research, a study was undertaken at a
   Brazilian residential building company. Multiple sources of evidence
   were used, including interviews, participant observations, and analysis
   of an existing database. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to
   build a word menu for customers to lodge a complaint. Moreover, a
   recommendation system was proposed based on machine learning (ML) and
   hierarchical defect classification. The system was designed to indicate
   which defects should be investigated during inspections. The main
   outcome of this investigation is an information management model that
   provides an effective classification system for customer complaints,
   supported by artificial intelligence (AI) applications that improve data
   collection, and introduce some degree of automation to warranty
   services. The main theoretical contribution of the study is the use of
   advanced data management approaches for managing complaints in
   residential building projects, resulting in the combination of inputs
   from technical and customer perspectives to support decision-making.},

Title = {Impact of Industry 4.0 Platform on the Formation of Construction 4.0
   Concept: A Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {In recent years, due to the rapid development of the fourth industrial
   revolution and new platforms of information technologies, intelligent
   systems have received widespread attention in many industries and have
   brought the potential to improve the efficiency of the construction
   industry. These facts led to the appearance of a new concept in
   construction industry called Construction 4.0. Therefore, this article
   seeks to explore the state of implementation of Industry 4.0
   technologies in the construction industry and analyze their impact on
   the formation of the Construction 4.0 concept. In order to achieve the
   aim of this article, a literature review was conducted using the most
   relevant publication in this field. Moreover, authors carried out a
   bibliometric analysis among 195 selected research articles related to
   the Industry 4.0 and Construction 4.0 to identify interconnections
   between these concepts. The results show that Industry 4.0 has the
   greatest impact on productivity growth in construction and that interest
   in digital technologies is growing every year, but their penetration
   into the construction industry is currently slow and limited. The
   authors suggest that further research needs to be focused on future
   ethical issues that may arise and on synergies between Construction 4.0
   technologies.},

   Images},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Reliable detection of underground infrastructure is essential for
   infrastructure modernization works, the implementation of BIM
   technology, and 3D cadasters. This requires shortening the time of data
   interpretation and the automation of the stage of selecting the objects.
   The main factor that influences the quality of radargrams is noise. The
   paper presents the method of data filtration with use of wavelet
   analyses and Gabor filtration. The authors were inspired to conduct the
   research by the fact that the interpretation and analysis of radargrams
   is time-consuming and by the wish to improve the accuracy of selection
   of the true objects by inexperienced operators. The authors proposed
   automated methods for the detection and classification of hyperboles in
   GPR images, which include the data filtration, detection, and
   classification of objects. The proposed object classification
   methodology based on the analytic hierarchy process method introduces a
   classification coefficient that takes into account the weights of the
   proposed conditions and weights of the coefficients. The effectiveness
   and quality of detection and classification of objects in radargrams
   were assessed. The proposed methods make it possible to shorten the time
   of the detection of objects. The developed hyperbola classification
   coefficients show promising results of the detection and classification
   of objects.},

Journal = {AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The construction sector has historically had lower productivity rates
   than other industries. This situation has led to the implementing new
   technologies and tools to increase the sector's added value. One of the
   significant trends has been digital transformation, adopting
   technological methodologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM),
   Drones, Automation, Apps, the Internet of Things, and Big Data.
   Implementing these technologies has improved processes; however, this
   change process has been slow and gradual and has not generated radical
   transformations. One of the most significant problems is the resistance
   to change at the organizational level. Therefore, the primary goal of
   this research is to analyze the interaction between organizational
   structure and digital transformation; this relationship could
   substantially improve construction services and products. A survey was
   designed and distributed to companies in the Colombian construction
   sector, using 13 variables that impact digital transformation and
   organizational structures. Three hundred thirty-two valid responses were
   collected; they were analyzed using descriptive statistics, factorial
   analysis, and logistic regressions. The results show that the main
   aspects impacting the digital transformation processes are Employee
   Training and Development, Promotion Opportunities, Business Strategy,
   Leadership Styles, Cloud Services, and Integrated Organizational
   Innovation. Companies should understand the advantages of digital
   transformation and the necessary changes to reach an optimal
   organizational structure; these improvements will directly relate to
   improving construction services and products.},

   and Documentation},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The construction industry has seen an increase in its complexity. This
   has meant an increased need for time-consuming and costly quality
   control. Moreover, the construction industry continues to perform
   detection-based quality controls with little to no focus on prevention.
   Quality control documentation is a source of information and data that
   can support the development of construction processes toward prevention.
   However, current documentations are ambiguous and subjective, so they
   remain ineffectual. A case study was performed to explore the causes of
   the ambiguity and subjectivity of traditional quality control
   documentation, and to analyze the identified project-variable
   procedure's transformation into standardized or even automated
   documentation. Evaluating the traditional quality control's preparation,
   inspection, and documentation phases highlighted unique challenges
   requiring tailored solutions. This study identifies the challenges of
   inaccurate data creation and data entry, unusable documentation, and
   inefficient documentation. Therefore, the usefulness of data structuring
   and process standardization became apparent. Hence, the study explores
   two solutions: a digitalized quality control system (DQCS) that ensures
   one accurate structured data entry method, and a centralized unit that
   prepares the necessary data for quality control inspections, instead of
   the unique preparation for each project. The results show the benefits
   of increased accuracy, usability, and efficiency for reliable on-site
   inspection and documentation.},

Title = {A Review of Ontology-Based Safety Management in Construction},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The construction industry is one of the most dangerous industries in
   terms of safety performance, with practitioners and experts actively
   developing various solutions to reduce accident frequency and severity.
   However, accident information is collected in a wide range of formats by
   various elements in the construction industry, leading to
   interoperability issues and poor productivity due to the difficulties of
   sharing and reusing information. To improve the management of various
   types of safety management (SM) records in the construction industry,
   practitioners and researchers have adopted ontological methods. This
   paper summarizes the SM trends in construction management, along with
   gaps and opportunities for future work. A data processing framework is
   developed with a phase research for objective and subjective topic
   analysis from a collection of articles from 2012-2022 on topics relevant
   to the use of ontology in SM. The analysis focuses on the ontological
   life cycle (development, integration, and application), revealing an
   increasing trend of ontology-based SM (ObSM) research in the SM
   maintenance phase. Increasing case size and system automation is needed
   for future ontology-based SM optimization. The findings of the study
   will help to gain a thorough knowledge of ObSM, which will increase
   interest in effectiveness and the use of engineering and analytical
   techniques in SM.},

Abstract = {The construction business is always changing, and with the introduction
   of artificial intelligence (AI) technology it is undergoing substantial
   modifications in a variety of areas. The purpose of this research paper
   is to investigate the function of AI tools in the construction industry
   using a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework based on
   the Delphi method, analytic network process (ANP), and Technique for
   Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) under a
   fuzzy scenario. The ANP framework offers a systematic approach to
   quantifying the relative importance of AI technologies based on expert
   opinions gathered during the Delphi process, whereas the fuzzy TOPSIS
   methodology is used to rank and select the most appropriate AI
   technologies for the construction industry. The final results from the
   ANP revealed that the technological factors are the most crucial,
   followed by the environmental factors, which highly influence the AI
   environment. In addition, TOPSIS identified robotics and automation as
   the best AI alternative among the three options, followed by building
   information modeling (BIM), whereas computer vision was the least
   preferred among the list. The proposed hybrid MCDM framework enables a
   comprehensive evaluation and selection process that takes into account
   the interdependencies between AI technologies and uncertainties in
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {Information bottlenecks are a central issue in architecture,
   engineering, and construction (AEC) projects. It is crucial to detect
   their occurrence to mitigate their impacts. Existing approaches to
   detect information bottlenecks use metrics that require estimating the
   quantity of information published, which is a challenging task in
   practice. In this paper, building on the literature and recent
   developments in automation, we introduce a revised model that uses
   unresolved activities during project delivery and frequency of
   information publication actions to detect information bottlenecks. We
   validated our model by applying it to a case study. We compared
   bottlenecks detected by our model to ground truth obtained in the case
   study independently using observational data and external verification.
   We further study how project activities requiring different levels of
   interactions among project participants with different roles (e.g.,
   designer, contractor) affect our model's performance. Results support
   our model and show that it is possible to attain comparable performance
   by considering only high-interdependency activities. Our research
   enables teams and project managers to keep a focus on issues that
   require intense communication among different experts and organizations
   to avoid bottleneck. Our contribution to the body of knowledge includes
   a revised model that detects information bottlenecks during project
   delivery and insights into integrative project management where the
   focus is on both project activities and collaboration needs across roles
   to streamline the whole process.},

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Building performance management requires massive data input; however,
   the relevant data are separated and heterogeneous; thus, it prevents a
   comprehensive building performance management. Building information
   modeling brings a new way to capture rich information of a building, and
   has great potential in data interoperability for building performance
   management. This article presents a scalable building information
   modeling-based cyber-physical platform for building performance
   monitoring to integrate heterogeneous data from different buildings. A
   smart sensor network based on Arduino and standard protocol is installed
   for data sensing and collection. A building information modeling-based
   sensing information model integrating heterogeneous data in a unified
   structure is proposed, and a scalable NoSQL database is established to
   store data in a cloud environment. A series of RESTful web services is
   developed to share data for building performance management
   applications. The proposed platform is developed taking the advantage of
   horizontal scalability of NoSQL database, and the data schema and
   services are generated automatically based on the unified data model.
   The platform has collected data from 77 buildings in China, and the
   results of a case study show the platform brings a new paradigm in
   collecting, storing, integrating, and sharing of sensor data and
   building information for building performance monitoring and analytics.},

Title = {Feature-Based Deep Learning Classification for Pipeline Component
   Extraction from 3D Point Clouds},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for construction component
   classification by designing a feature-based deep learning network to
   tackle the automation problem in construction digitization. Although
   scholars have proposed a variety of ways to achieve the use of deep
   learning to classify point clouds, there are few practical engineering
   applications in the construction industry. However, in the process of
   building digitization, the level of manual participation has
   significantly reduced the efficiency of digitization and increased the
   application restrictions. To address this problem, we propose a robust
   classification method using deep learning networks, which is combined
   with traditional shape features for the point cloud of construction
   components. The proposed method starts with local and global feature
   extraction, where global features processed by the neural network and
   the traditional shape features are processed separately. Then, we
   generate a feature map and perform deep convolution to achieve feature
   fusion. Finally, experiments are designed to prove the efficiency of the
   proposed method based on the construction dataset we establish. This
   paper fills in the lack of deep learning applications of point clouds in
   construction component classification. Additionally, this paper provides
   a feasible solution to improve the construction digitization efficiency
   and provides an available dataset for future work.},

Title = {Effect of Smart Construction Technology Characteristics on the Safety
   Performance of Construction Projects: An Empirical Analysis Based on
   Structural Equation Modeling},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The application of smart construction technologies is becoming a crucial
   approach to improving safety performance in the construction industry.
   Existing research often focuses on the qualitative analysis of specific
   technologies, neglecting a comprehensive empirical examination of the
   characteristics of smart construction technologies and their impact on
   project safety performance. This study identifies five principal
   characteristics of smart construction technology: integration,
   automation, initiative, shareability, and sustainability. By integrating
   the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the task-technology fit (TTF)
   model, we propose a theoretical path of ``technology
   characteristics-perceived behavior-behavioral intention-safety
   performance{''} and develop a structural equation model to assess the
   effect of these characteristics on safety performance. The results
   indicate that these characteristics have a significant direct impact on
   safety performance, with the estimated direct effect reaching as high as
   0.61. Additionally, these characteristics positively influence safety
   performance indirectly through mediating variables such as perceived
   ease of use, perceived usefulness, usage intention, and usage behavior.
   This study empirically verifies the pathways through which smart
   construction technology characteristics affect safety performance,
   providing theoretical support for the widespread application of these
   technologies in construction engineering and enhancing safety
   management.},

Abstract = {Purpose The green building (GB) maintenance industry has been under
   increasing pressure by designers to demonstrate its evaluation and
   information management of building information modelling based model
   checking (BMC) to the competency's performance and design knowledge of
   building control instrument. This main problem has been termed as
   maintenance planning level. Although maintenance planning has been
   explored in GB maintenance environments, less is known about what
   maintenance planning problems currently exist and what their causes are,
   such as the recent fire in the Grenfell Tower (14 June 2017, about 80
   fatalities) in North Kensington, West London. The aim of this paper is
   to identify how GB maintenance environments could integrate BMC within
   their processes. The purpose of this study is to assess the BMC
   technology management of GB maintenance ecosystem and that of a soft
   skills level to establish the impact of innovation policy features on
   database and safety risk function mechanism. Design/methodology/approach
   To achieve this aim, a comprehensive literature review of the existing
   conceptualisation of BMC practices is reviewed and the main features of
   Information and Communication Technology tools and techniques currently
   being employed on such GB maintenance ecosystem is carried out to
   evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the previous studies. The
   conceptual framework explores the importance of integration of BMC in
   the construction phase to identify alternative methods in the automation
   system (AS) process to co-generate, monitor and optimise BMC. Findings
   The results confirm that BMC tool positively influences database
   application and risk mechanism of construction project safety while
   agreeableness negatively does. Besides, database application has a
   negative influence on innovation policy of company towards BMC
   implementation. Propositions derived not only shed light on guidance for
   future research on the soft skills of construction organisations, but
   also provide decision-making support through a better understanding of
   the factors affecting soft skills level amongst biggest construction
   companies. Originality/value Thus far, this study advances the knowledge
   about how GB maintenance environments can ensure BMC delivery. This
   paper highlights the need for further research to integrate BMC in GB
   maintenance environments validates the framework across the construction
   phase with different GB project managers and engineers.},

Abstract = {Historical heritage is demanding robust pipelines for obtaining Heritage
   Building Information Modeling models that are fully interoperable and
   rich in their informative content. The definition of efficient
   Scan-to-BIM workflows represent a very important step toward a more
   efficient management of the historical real estate, as creating
   structured three-dimensional (3D) models from point clouds is complex
   and time-consuming. In this scenario, semantic segmentation of 3D Point
   Clouds is gaining more and more attention, since it might help to
   automatically recognize historical architectural elements. The way paved
   by recent Deep Learning approaches proved to provide reliable and
   affordable degrees of automation in other contexts, as road scenes
   understanding. However, semantic segmentation is particularly
   challenging in historical and classical architecture, due to the shapes
   complexity and the limited repeatability of elements across different
   buildings, which makes it difficult to define common patterns within the
   same class of elements. Furthermore, as Deep Learning models requires a
   considerably large amount of annotated data to be trained and tuned to
   properly handle unseen scenes, the lack of (big) publicly available
   annotated point clouds in the historical building domain is a huge
   problem, which in fact blocks the research in this direction. However,
   creating a critical mass of annotated point clouds by manual annotation
   is very time-consuming and impractical. To tackle this issue, in this
   work we explore the idea of leveraging synthetic point cloud data to
   train Deep Learning models to perform semantic segmentation of point
   clouds obtained via Terrestrial Laser Scanning. The aim is to provide a
   first assessment of the use of synthetic data to drive Deep
   Learning-based semantic segmentation in the context of historical
   buildings. To achieve this purpose, we present an improved version of
   the Dynamic Graph CNN (DGCNN) named RadDGCNN. The main improvement
   consists on exploiting the radius distance. In our experiments, we
   evaluate the trained models on synthetic dataset (publicly available)
   about two different historical buildings: the Ducal Palace in Urbino,
   Italy, and Palazzo Ferretti in Ancona, Italy. RadDGCNN yields good
   results, demonstrating improved segmentation performances on the TLS
   real datasets.},

Title = {Methods for the Automated Assignment and Comparison of Building Damage
   Geometries},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Condition assessment of structures supports effective repair,
   restoration or reconstruction works on buildings of infrastructural or
   cultural importance and is therefore an important contribution to
   building and infrastructure sustainability. Due to increasing ageing and
   external influences continuous monitoring is obligatory to maintain the
   structures. Throughout the entire life cycle, digital scans of changing
   damages and the building geometry, up to the degree of a digital twin,
   can be acquired using modern inspection methods. This allows for the
   automation of condition assessment processes to locate, quantify and
   predict damage progression at a structure related to building
   information models. However, the usual inspection documentation as
   performed in the past neither includes an assignment of damages to
   digital building models nor relates the history of recordings to a
   damage entity, which consequently makes a direct condition state
   comparison unfeasible.
   The paper presents voxel based methods for the automated assignment of
   geometrical representations of damages to elements of a corresponding
   building model as well as to past damage scans, which describe the same
   damage entity. Furthermore, the comparison and computation of discrete
   geometric changes based on the assignments is shown. Additionally, the
   clustering of scanned damage geometries into interest areas for the
   usage in planning processes for further inspections is presented. The
   resulting set of methods enables an automated condition comparison of
   damages on each surveyed state of the structure and supports the
   integration of inspection data to building information models.},

Abstract = {Two of the differential characteristics of the AECO sector
   (architecture, engineering, construction and operation) are barriers for
   the mass creation of training materials for its workers. On the one
   hand, the workplace is unique and changing over time; on the other, the
   aging trend of its workers and the unattractive nature of the industry
   for new generations of professionals. These two problems can be tackled
   by virtual reality technologies, which allow the agile creation of all
   kinds of scenarios, while their current technology may be attractive to
   young people and intuitive for everyone. This work shows the results of
   an investigation that seeks to provide automated tools based on virtual
   reality experiences to support learning in occupational risk prevention.
   This objective is part of the development of a culture for prevention,
   which allows the treatment of the human factor, with all its complexity
   and casuistry. The proposal includes the development of a process and
   tools that allow replicating the specific scenario where the work will
   be carried out, incorporating risks and probable incidents,
   systematically establishing cause-effect relationships, incorporating a
   narrative (storytelling) that provides emotional meaning to users and
   Lastly, the creation of a workflow that facilitates the agile
   development of these virtual reality experiences for each specific work.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper presents a case study of an energy efficient and cost
   optimized design of a light gauge steel building. The structural
   analyses conducted were linked to the concept of design for manufacture
   and assembly (DfMA) for the optimization of assembly time, quantity of
   labors and materials. A variety of analyses were performed on a
   prefabricated residential building constructed with cold formed and hot
   rolled steel materials for comparison which has a limited research
   previously. The energy optimization for the prefabricated building was
   carried out using Autodesk Insight 360. Several tools for structural,
   thermal, energy and cost analyses were adopted in this research. A
   Building Information Model (BIM) was developed in Revit and structural
   model in ETABS for structural analysis. Thermal performance was executed
   using Simulinks in MATLAB followed by energy simulations in
   DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus software packages. The material and energy
   costs of the designed building were estimated using CostX tool. From the
   analysis, the optimal window-wall ratio (WWR) was found to be 10\%- 15\%
   produced better energy and cost savings. Furthermore, the total energy
   consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the building was found to be
   reduced by 28.7\%- 31.5\% with an application of insulation in its
   external walls in simulations. Improved bending capacity and shear force
   for CFS compared to RHS was observed. Finally, a framework was proposed
   for the automation and interoperability of building analysis tools.},

Title = {On-Site Construction Quality Inspection Using Blockchain and Smart
   Contracts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Typically, on-site construction quality inspection (OCQI) is manually
   conducted, and its effectiveness highly depends on the self-discipline
   of responsible personnel. Furthermore, construction quality information
   is still recorded on paper, with the risk of document loss and data
   manipulation, jeopardizing quality accountability. Blockchain has
   attracted increasing attention from the construction industry because it
   can record information in an immutable and transparent way and automate
   some businesses with smart contracts. These properties can tackle
   information fraud and improve the automation level of OCQI.
   Unfortunately, very few documented blockchain solutions for OCQI exist.
   To fill the theoretical knowledge gap, the design thinking approach was
   adopted to present a blockchain-based conceptual framework. The
   consortium network and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) were selected as the
   suitable blockchain type and development platform for OCQI. The
   consensus process in HLF and smart contracts-based compliance checking
   are illustrated. Moreover, the benefits of integrating the Internet of
   Things (IoT) and ontology technology with blockchain are analyzed in
   detail, which can facilitate the coevaluation of these three
   technologies. Finally, a prototype system was developed to vividly show
   the theoretical feasibility. The proposed blockchain solution can be
   fine-tuned and evaluated in future research. Challenges hindering the
   practical implementation of blockchains are systematically discussed
   within the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theory, which can
   be reused in future investigations to identify construction
   stakeholders' concerns on adopting blockchains.},

Title = {Dynamic knowledge graph applications for augmented built environments
   through ``The World Avatar{''}},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {91},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The proliferation of digital building models in recent years has led to
   a corresponding rise in specialised, non-interoperable models. These
   models impede sustainable developments by forming data silos that hinder
   cross-application data exchange and knowledge discovery processes.
   Although Semantic Web solutions hold promise in addressing these silos,
   current approaches primarily focus on developing novel ontologies,
   yielding similar outcomes. But it is unclear how these methodologies
   could support broader knowledge discovery processes and application
   requirements. This paper addresses these research challenges by
   introducing a dynamic knowledge graph as implemented within The World
   Avatar for interoperable building models. We demonstrate its value
   through two distinct applications in urban energy management and
   laboratory automation. The dynamic knowledge graph revolves around a
   comprehensive structured knowledge model constructed from ontologies and
   agents. Ontologies semantically annotate data and represent domain
   knowledge and their relationships with standardised definitions. When
   augmented with an agent architecture, the resulting knowledge model can
   align stakeholder perspectives and accommodate the dynamic and scalable
   nature of urban data. Moreover, the dynamic knowledge graph fosters
   innovative human-machine interactions through visualisation interfaces
   to augment knowledge discovery processes in the built environment for
   greater efficiencies and innovation. As the knowledge model expands,
   users gain access to a broader spectrum of private and public data
   sources and technologies, while reducing integration barriers. This is
   especially pertinent for smaller and less influential entities like
   municipal and local governments with limited resources, who can realise
   substantial benefits at reduced costs.},

Title = {Comparative Analysis of Manual and Robotic Concrete Drilling for
   Installation Hangers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Robots have increased the safety, productivity, and quality of
   manufacturing. Recently, sensing, computing, and mapping technologies
   have started to enable the use of robots in unstructured environments
   like construction. As robotic construction methods are being prototyped
   and adopted on site, innovation leaders in construction must analyze the
   safety, productivity, quality, and cost impacts of the deployment of
   robots. The researchers gained access to engineering, planning, and
   production data for the first use of a concrete drilling robot on site.
   This paper compares the traditional way of drilling holes with the
   robotic way. Compared to manual drilling for installation hangers, the
   robot achieved a 10\% time reduction, increased task ergonomics by
   cutting 98\% of muscle strain work hours, and reduced rework from 5\% to
   3\%. Our comparison pays particular attention to the three levers a
   project team has to influence project outcomes-the product, the
   organization, and the process-and found that decisions like implementing
   a building information model (BIM) at Level of Development (LOD) 400
   facilitated the robot use. This study makes two contributions to the
   fields of construction robotics and project management: First, this
   research shares a careful analysis of the application of a drilling
   robot to offer insights into the applicability of robots on site.
   Second, this analysis suggests key elements and procedures of a
   framework to compare robotic and traditional construction methods.
   Future research should establish the generality of this analysis
   framework. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},

Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Quality and efficiency of the work environment are essential to the
   well-being, health and productivity of employees. Despite the increasing
   focus on these aspects, many workplaces currently do not fully meet the
   needs and expectations of employees, with negative consequences for
   their well-being and productivity. The research aims to develop a system
   based on the Smart Building and Digital Twin paradigm, focusing on the
   implementation of various IoT components, the creation of automation
   flows for energy-efficient lighting, HVAC and indoor air quality control
   systems, and decision support through real-time data visualization
   enabled by user interfaces and dashboards integrating the geometric and
   information model (BIM). The system also aims to provide a tool for both
   monitoring and simulation/planning/decision support through the
   processing and development of machine learning (ML) algorithms. In
   relation to emergency management, real-time data can be acquired,
   allowing information to be shared with users and building managers
   through the creation of dashboards and visual analysis. After defining
   the functional requirements and identifying all3 the monitorable
   quantities that can be translated into requirements, the system
   architecture is described, the implementation of the case study is
   illustrated and the preliminary results of the first data collection
   campaign and initial estimates of future forecasts are shown.},

Year = {2025},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In response to the problems of low accuracy, low efficiency, and
   insufficient data security in building information modeling models, an
   automation scheme based on deep learning and differential privacy is
   introduced to improve the efficiency and security of construction
   projects. Firstly, this article utilized residual network and long
   short-term memory models to extract features from the spatial structure
   and temporal information of the building information modeling model.
   Secondly, it used the Adam optimizer for gradient descent to optimize
   network weights; then, for the evaluation of geometric accuracy and data
   integrity, this article adjusted the number of network layers and
   convolution kernel size. At the same time, this article integrated a
   differential privacy framework into the model, dynamically adjusted the
   privacy budget, and finally evaluated the building information modeling
   model for automated generation and protection. The research results
   indicated that the building information modeling model had an accuracy
   of 0.94 in aligning the edges of the structural framework, and the
   internal partition wall angle deviation was only 0.10. Its error in the
   area covered by internal partitions and floors was only 0.04, with a
   success rate of 0.82 for data leakage risk, a detection rate of 0.91,
   and a response time of 0.09 s. The model can ensure the security of
   critical information while achieving high accuracy and efficiency.},

Title = {Automation of Inspection Mission Planning Using 4D BIMs and in Support
   of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Based Data Collection},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {147},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The data collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provide unique
   opportunities for applications, such as construction progress tracking
   and facility monitoring. To increase the effectiveness of UAV-captured
   data, inspection mission plans should be designed prior to site visits.
   The data collection locations must be identified and adjusted based on
   the user's objectives. The UAV flight mission must guarantee a visit to
   each identified location, and the inspection plans must satisfy the
   constraints imposed by safety requirements, no-fly zones, and UAV's
   limited battery life. This problem becomes more complicated indoors due
   to complex and continuously changing building layouts. This work uses
   four-dimensional (4D) building information models (BIM) to automatically
   design optimal UAV mission plans in support of indoor UAV-enabled data
   acquisition. It automatically identifies the inspection targets based on
   users' customizable and multi-criteria description of objectives (e.g.,
   columns behind schedule). The three-dimensional (3D) navigable space is
   automatically calculated by time stamping the 4D models based on the
   inspection date. The navigable space is further refined based on safety
   rules. An optimal UAV inspection mission plan is developed using swarm
   intelligence that ensures complete coverage of targets and minimizes
   battery use. The method is based on the industry foundation classes
   (IFC) schema, promoting OpenBIM and interoperability, which are core
   challenges in the construction information modeling domain. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Purpose The momentous contribution of innovative technologies has made a
   significant impact in several sectors globally. However, the
   construction industry is undoubtedly lagging when it comes to technology
   usage. Thus, this study aims to explore the various emerging
   technologies in the construction industry while noticing stakeholders'
   challenges and strategies in its use. Design/methodology/approach The
   study used a pragmatism research philosophy together with a quantitative
   research strategy in determining emerging technologies in the
   construction industry while noticing stakeholder challenges and
   strategies. Data were obtained from a total of 80 construction
   stakeholders through a structured questionnaire survey. The analysis was
   done with descriptive statistics using mean score ranking and a
   one-sample t-test. Findings Each emerging technology challenge was
   analysed and compared to see how pressing the challenges were as well as
   the aligned strategies. A key indication of this study is that the
   familiarity of the various emerging technologies was based on how many
   occasions one had an encounter with the technology. Practical
   implications The discussion's findings contribute to a better knowledge
   to construction stakeholders on the challenges and strategies for rising
   technology adoption and implementation competencies. Originality/value
   The study reckoned stakeholders' challenges on the emerging technologies
   in the construction industry context and recommended strategies to
   balloon the adoption of these emerging technologies in a developing
   country setting.},

Title = {Generalized Adaptive Framework for Computerizing the Building Design
   Review Process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Engineering design review is the process of assessing a design against
   codes and standards requirements to validate the accuracy and quality of
   the design and detecting problems before manufacturing and assembly
   begin. Building design regulations are normally in the form of texts,
   charts, tables, and mathematical expressions. These regulations and
   guidelines usually have legal status. Nevertheless, the cognitive and
   logical ability of the people is dissimilar to anything executed in
   computing machines. Consequently, the computerization of this process
   represents an actual challenge to the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry. Most of the cited methods for automated
   rules compliance auditing are either based on proprietary,
   domain-specific, or hard-coded rule-based representations, which may be
   useful in their specific applications. However, these methods have the
   disadvantages of being costly to maintain, cumbersome to modify, and
   lacking a comprehensive schema of rules and regulations modeling that
   can adapt to different domains, and thus don't support an open data
   standard. They are often denoted as black box or gray box methods. This
   work offers a new comprehensive framework that reduces the deficiencies
   of the current approaches. The primary goal is to tackle the problem by
   concentrating on establishing a generalized adaptive framework (GAF) for
   a neutral data standard {[}such as the Industry Foundation Classes
   (IFC)] that enables automation of building design review processes to
   achieve design accuracy and efficiency.},

Title = {Semantic and ontology-based analysis of regulatory documents for
   construction industry digitalization},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {In the context of the digitalization of the construction industry, the
   demand for automation in the analysis of regulatory documents is
   increasing. The significant volume, structural complexity, and frequent
   amendments of regulatory acts lead to semantic inconsistencies,
   duplication of provisions, and contradictions in requirements. The aim
   of this study is to develop a method for the automated analysis of
   regulatory documents in the construction sector based on the integration
   of ontological modeling and natural language processing (NLP)
   techniques. The relevance of the topic is driven by the need for the
   digital transformation of construction standardization, which involves
   eliminating redundant provisions, logical inconsistencies, and outdated
   references in the regulatory framework. The study proposes a methodology
   for constructing semantic ``profiles{''} of regulatory statements, which
   include structured components: subject, predicate, object, modality, and
   additional conditions. A software prototype has been developed,
   implementing an algorithm for semantic matching of regulatory
   requirements using an ontological model that incorporates SKOS-based
   terminology, deontic logic, and domain-specific concepts of the
   construction sector. Experiments were conducted on a corpus of 14
   regulatory documents of the Republic of Kazakhstan (approximate to
   242,000 words), demonstrating high computational efficiency (document
   analysis time <10 s) and acceptable quality metrics (F1-score up to
   0.86). The results confirm the applicability of the proposed method for
   integration into automated regulatory compliance control systems and
   Building Information Modeling (BIM).},

Title = {Measurement of Information Loss and Transfer Impacts of Technology
   Systems in Offsite Construction Processes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {149},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Offsite construction, also known as industrialized/prefabricated
   construction, is an alternative approach to delivering construction
   projects, compared to the on-site stick-built/built-on-site construction
   approach. Today's offsite construction processes often use technology
   systems (e.g., digital design tools and automated machinery) to increase
   productivity and improve product quality. These systems operate
   collectively and rely on information generated in different operating
   environments. Therefore, information interoperability is critical to
   achieving overall construction efficiency and economics. This creates a
   need to study the impacts of information loss and transfer due to
   information interoperability, specifically for offsite construction
   processes. Given this, the paper uses a qualitative (case study)
   approach to document the offsite construction processes and the
   information requirements for each process. The efforts spent on
   information generation and transfer are taken as inputs for calculating
   the information loss and transfer impact using a quantitative (Monte
   Carlo simulation) approach. It contributes to the body of knowledge with
   (1) documentation of the current offsite construction processes based on
   wood panelized construction and the information requirements for all
   involved technology systems; (2) a case study approach that can be
   generically applied in other offsite construction companies to capture
   the information efficiency due to information interoperability; and (3)
   a generic simulation-based approach to measure the impacts of
   information loss and transfer between processes. As a result, the paper
   proposes phases of technology adoption and strategies for offsite
   construction companies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Number = {5},
Pages = {1491-1504},

Abstract = {Purpose The current movement toward digitisation has promoted the
   adoption of smart building technology globally. Despite its advantages,
   its usage in developing countries such as Nigeria is still very low.
   Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate construction
   professionals' awareness of smart building concepts (SBCs) in the
   Nigerian construction industry and identify the parameters by which SBCs
   can be measured. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative survey was
   carried out using a questionnaire to gather relevant data in the study
   area. This paper was conducted on 363 registered construction
   professionals in the Nigerian construction industry. The collected data
   were analysed using descriptive statistics and Kruskal-Wallis H test
   analysis. Findings This paper indicated that the majority of Nigerian
   construction professionals are aware of SBCs. Furthermore, the
   Kruskal-Wallis H test shows no significant difference between the
   awareness level of the various construction professionals. This paper
   further revealed energy management systems, IT network connectivity,
   safety and security management systems and building automation systems
   as the most significant parameters in which SBCs can be measured.
   Practical implications This paper identified significant parameters
   influencing SBCs awareness in the Nigerian construction industry. These
   parameters can be integrated into the building during the design stage
   and can be incorporated into the policymaking process of construction
   firms to promote the awareness of SBCs and encourage practices related
   to construction sustainability. Originality/value This paper provides
   empirical evidence on the awareness of SBCs among construction
   professionals and significant parameters influencing awareness in the
   Nigerian construction industry.},

Title = {Digital Twin Technology for Bridge Maintenance using 3D Laser Scanning:
   A Review},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 14},
Abstract = {There has been a significant surge in the interest in adopting
   cutting-edge new technologies in the civil engineering industry in
   recent times that monitor the Internet of Things (IoT) data and control
   automation systems. By combining the real and digital worlds, digital
   technologies, such as Digital Twin, provide a high-level depiction of
   bridges and their assets. The inspection, evaluation, and management of
   infrastructure have experienced profound changes in technological
   advancement over the last decade. Technologies like laser scanners have
   emerged as a viable replacement for labor-intensive, costly, and
   dangerous traditional methods that risk health and safety. The new
   maintenance techniques have increased their use in the construction
   section, particularly regarding bridges. This review paper aims to
   present a comprehensive and state-of-the-art review upon using laser
   scanners in bridge maintenance and engineering and looking deeper into
   the study field in focus and researchers' suggestions in this field.
   Moreover, the review was conducted to gather, evaluate, and analyze the
   papers collected in the years from 2017 to 2022. The interaction of
   research networks, dominant subfields, the co-occurrence of keywords,
   and countries were all examined. Four main categories were presented,
   namely machine learning, bridge management system (BMS), bridge
   information modeling (BrIM), and 3D modeling. The findings demonstrate
   that information standardization is the first significant obstacle to be
   addressed before the construction sector can benefit from the usage of
   Digital Twin. As a result, this article proposes a conceptual framework
   for building management using Digital Twins as a starting point for
   future research.},

Abstract = {PurposeFacilities management (FM) activities affect citizens' health and
   safety, long-term urban environmental sustainability and the
   relationships between the built and natural environments of cities. This
   study aims to comprehend the status of smart FM tools application, how
   they are used to improve the delivery of FM services and the barriers to

   current smart solutions that leverage the quality of FM service, a case
   study based on the FM practice in Hong Kong was carried out. The case
   study was conducted in two phases of data acquisition based on a
   qualitative research methodology. After conducting in-depth interviews
   to determine the application of smart FM tools in different types of

Abstract = {In competitive growth and Industry 4.0, construction prediction and
   management have a key role. To find a way to provide a simulation method
   for the damage assessment of buildings and Industry 4.0, building
   information modelling technology is the most suitable choice. This work
   presents and analyses the building material from design modelling to
   model information extraction, virtual construction, and an imported
   virtual simulation engine. A simulation system has been built to
   understand the force and material collision detection of buildings, and
   a three-dimensional (3D) simulation platform is developed based on the
   Unity3D engine. A 3D display of building model and simulation data is
   realized in this work based on the simulation software platform. The
   results show that the building 3D simulation images constructed by the
   designed system are high definition, take little time, and have
   excellent performance. The outcomes are realized in terms of the
   engineering cost ratio and have energy consumption and efficiency values
   of 20\% and 40\%, respectively, which are much better than the
   traditional method. Efficiency has also improved to 76\% from the
   traditional method using the proposed method, which makes it a robust
   platform for construction prediction and management in industries. The
   virtual simulation technology is applied to solve problems of building
   design and damage assessment. The influence of this technology on the
   overall design of the building is discussed, followed by future
   development directions for industrial automation.},

Title = {Automated Positioning of Anchors for Personal Fall Arrest Systems for
   Steep-Sloped Roofs},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Falls account for about one-third of all construction fatalities with
   most fatalities in the roofing trade. Even though a personal fall arrest
   system (PFAS) is required for fall protection, proper placement of PFAS
   anchor points is an issue evidenced by the high number of fatalities
   caused by incorrect anchor positioning. The research goal was to proof
   the concept of optimizing the location of the PFAS anchor points on
   steep-sloped roofs. This goal was achieved by: (1) Developing an
   algorithm for converting the required local jurisdiction construction
   regulations and standards for PFAS anchor positioning into
   machine-readable rules; and (2) Developing and validating an algorithm
   for optimizing the location of PFAS anchor points. The K-Nearest
   Neighbor Search (KNNS) optimization algorithm was selected in this
   research and was implemented into a standalone computer tool using
   Python programming language. The tool calculates the potential anchor
   locations that satisfy the fall clearance and swing hazard requirements
   and then displays the anchor locations both graphically and numerically.
   The optimization algorithm was validated using the K-fold
   Cross-Validation method, which proved the algorithm was adequately
   accurate and consistent. The research contribution is the proof of the
   concept that the development of an optimization algorithm and automated
   field-level tool for optimal selection of PFAS anchor points is
   possible, further research and refinement could help steep-sloped
   roofing companies improve their safety practices.},

Title = {Scientometric Analysis for Cross-Laminated Timber in the Context of
   Construction 4.0},
Journal = {AUTOMATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {439-470},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cross-laminated timber (CLT) has been one of the principal materials in
   mass timber construction, and now it is possible to find mid-rise and
   high-rise projects around the globe. This study makes a scientometric
   review comparison between CLT and the impact of the fourth industrial
   revolution (formally known as Industry 4.0) in the construction
   industry, focusing on worldwide academic publications between 2006 and
   2022. The analysis considers keywords, co-author, co-citation, and
   clustering analysis. This study used 1320 documents, including journals
   and conference proceedings from the Scopus database, where 753 were for
   cross-laminated timber and 567 for Industry 4.0. Key researchers,
   research institutions, journals, publications, citation patterns, and
   trends are some of the results obtained from the scientometric analysis.
   Once the knowledge mapping was conducted for both fields, scrutiny of
   the interconnection of both areas was performed to find possible
   research gaps from a manufacturing perspective. Among the conclusions,
   it is logical to say that Industry 4.0 implementation in cross-laminated
   timber is still in its infancy. One of the most popular technologies
   impacting construction is the digital twin concept; however, no work is
   reported for CLT on this topic. Additionally, digital automation is a
   necessity in any research practice, and the use of industrial robots is
   shown to be an essential asset for CLT as these robots can handle
   complex shapes.},

Title = {A DESIGN REVIEW SESSION PROTOCOL FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IMMERSIVE
   VIRTUAL REALITY IN USABILITY-FOCUSED ANALYSIS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {233-253},
Abstract = {Research and applications related to Virtual Reality (VR) in the
   Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Facility Management (AEC/FM)
   industry are steadily increasing, being considered as one of the current
   trends in digital innovation. A convergence is currently on-going
   between Building Information Modelling (BIM), VR implementation and the
   soft landings principles, which highlight the need for a smooth
   transition from design to operation through the early involvement of
   clients and end-users. In particular, immersive virtual environments
   could allow stakeholders to experience the full-scale representation of
   a virtual facility prototype in an intuitive and engaging manner through
   immersion and sense of presence, promoting feedback collection during
   usability-focused design review meetings. On the other hand, despite the
   renewed interest in immersive VR, both technological and procedural
   challenges to its effective implementation still exist. The latter are
   within the scope of this study, which aims to address them in a
   systematic way as a comprehensive guideline for clients and design
   teams. This study describes the development of a VR-aided
   usability-focused design review session protocol for implementing
   immersive VR when clients and end-users are involved in design review
   meetings. It is the result of an inductive approach associated with
   qualitative research methods for data collection and data analysis. A
   case study has been selected as a main research method for facing the
   first step into the research problem. A further iteration of data
   collection and analysis was adopted to guarantee the validity of the
   research, including talks with experts and literature comparison.
   Finally, the session protocol has been developed in the form of a
   process map representing all the necessary phases and activities to
   consider for the effective adoption of immersive VR to evaluate design
   intents with clients and end-users. As a comprehensive summary, the
   session protocol fills a gap in the research on the adoption of virtual
   reality in the AEC industry, which was lacking a prescriptive and
   structured process to drive the effective use of this technology in
   collaborative meetings and decision-making processes.},

Title = {Automatic Generation of Pipe Routing for Variable Refrigerant Flow Air
   Conditioning System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {100},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The traditional design of variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air
   conditioning system relies heavily on the expertise and experience of
   designers. Designers spend considerable time modifying the drawings to
   accommodate design alternations. This paper aims to develop an automated
   routing method for refrigerant piping in VRF systems, based on building
   information modeling (BIM). The proposed methodology includes automatic
   zoning of the VRF system, automatic layout of indoor units, and
   automatic generation of refrigerant piping. To achieve system zoning, a
   combination of hierarchical clustering and rule-based methods are
   employed, while a geometric recognition method is utilized for the
   obstacle-avoiding layout of the indoor units. The escape graph method is
   applied for spatial modeling, and an ant colony optimization (ACO)
   approach with a concurrent search strategy is applied for
   multi-objective path optimization. This approach facilitates the
   automatic generation of the optimal orthogonal branch pipe route while
   ensuring obstacle avoidance. Moreover, a breadth-first search (BFS)
   approach is employed, considering 12 potential forms of divergence tube
   connections within the pipeline, which are sequentially integrated into
   the pre-generated piping layout. This paper presents the results of
   testing conducted on two engineering buildings modeled in Revit. The
   outcomes align with engineering standards, thus demonstrating the
   feasibility of the proposed method. Compared to traditional manual
   drafting, this automated method can complete the piping layout in just a
   few seconds, significantly reducing design and drawing time. This
   advancement further enhances the level of intelligence and automation in
   the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system design.},

Title = {Construction 4.0 in a narrow and broad sense: A systematic and
   comprehensive literature review},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {244},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {This article presents a systematic review that assesses the implication
   of Construction 4.0 from both a narrow perspective centred on technology
   adaptation, and a broader perspective that includes the implications of
   Construction 4.0 on society, environment, governance, and technology
   itself (referred to as `SEGT dimensions'). The review draws on a
   systematic selection and analysis of 131 primary sources, including
   peer-reviewed articles, books, and chapters published between 2016 and
   2023. The analysis of the literature consistently reveals a discernible
   pattern: (i) a notable gap between theoretical propositions and
   practical implementation of Construction 4.0 technologies, processes,
   and strategies; (ii) a range of barriers hindering the effective
   adoption of this transformative paradigm such as significant upfront
   costs associated with integrating Construction 4.0 technologies, a
   shortage of skilled personnel adept in utilizing these technologies,
   inadequate regulatory frameworks, hesitancy among construction
   leadership, and a deep-seated aversion to change within the industry;
   and, (iii) a lack of understanding in the policy and scholarly community
   about the impact of Construction 4.0 on the SEGT dimensions. The article
   warns for unfounded technocratic optimism about Construction 4.0; calls
   for a holistic application of this `new' paradigm and refrain from
   cherry-picking `cheap and easy' technologies and applications; and
   suggests that the con-struction industry may be able to leapfrog the
   `4.0' revolution and directly embrace a `5.0' approach by incorporating
   a human-centric perspective and focusing on how technology and
   automation can help address the central challenges of the 21st century.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential
   integration of deep learning (DL) and digital twins (DT), referred to as
   (DDT), to facilitate Construction 4.0 through an exploratory analysis.
   Design/methodology/approach A mixed approach involving qualitative and
   quantitative analysis was applied to collect data from global industry
   experts via interviews, focus groups and a questionnaire survey, with an
   emphasis on the practicality and interoperability of DDT with
   decision-support capabilities for process optimization. Findings Based
   on the analysis of results, a conceptual model of the framework has been
   developed. The research findings validate that DL integrated DT model
   facilitating Construction 4.0 will incorporate cognitive abilities to
   detect complex and unpredictable actions and reasoning about dynamic
   process optimization strategies to support decision-making. Practical
   implications The DL integrated DT model will establish an interoperable
   functionality and develop typologies of models described for autonomous
   real-time interpretation and decision-making support of complex building
   systems development based on cognitive capabilities of DT.
   Originality/value The research explores how the technologies work
   collaboratively to integrate data from different environments in
   real-time through the interplay of the optimization and simulation
   during planning and construction. The framework model is a step for the
   next level of DT involving process automation and control towards
   Construction 4.0 to be implemented for different phases of the project
   lifecycle (design-planning-construction).},

Title = {INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS IN CONSTRUCTION
   ORGANIZATIONS: A SCIENTOMETRIC REVIEW},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {286-305},
Abstract = {The application and research of Information and Communication Technology
   has exponentially grown in construction and is of a multidiscipline
   nature. However, there is a lack of investigation into progression of
   ICT research topics within the construction disciplines and the
   knowledge domain has not been deeply explored. This research fills this
   gap using a scientometric review of construction ICT research. Relevant
   literature from reputable sources are reviewed and classified to create
   a comprehensive framework for ICT application in construction.
   Accordingly, a manual review of research titles, as well as abstracts,
   was conducted. Accordingly, five analysis steps were performed including
   ``Journals Selection, Publication Type and Name{''} ``Citation
   Analysis{''}, ``Keywords Co -Occurrence Network{''}, ``Cluster
   Analysis{''}, and ``Keyword time analysis{''}. A total of 376 research
   selected for burst detection, co-citation analysis, cluster analysis,
   keyword co-releases, and ICT application analysis in order to provide a
   comprehensive knowledge summary of the ICT application in the
   construction industry. Automation in Construction and Journal of
   Management in Engineering were identified as the major journals
   associated with research on the ICT application in the construction
   industry. Based on the research method, the articles used for

Title = {Generative Design Methodology and Framework Exploiting
   Designer-Algorithm Synergies},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Designing is a problem-solving activity. The process is usually
   iterative: a solution is proposed, then analysed and tested until it
   satisfies all constraints and best fulfils the criteria. Usually, a
   designer proposes a solution based on intuition, experience, and
   knowledge. However, this does not work for problems they are facing for
   the first time. An alternative approach is generative design, where the
   designer focuses on iteratively defining a problem with its constraints
   and criteria in the form of a parametric computational model, and then
   leaves the search for the solution to the algorithms and their ability
   to rapidly generate and test several alternatives. The result of this
   approach is not only a set of solutions embedding implicitly the
   knowledge but also a model where problem-defining knowledge is quite
   explicit. The idea of the proposed approach is the exploitation of
   synergies between the designer and the algorithms. The designer focuses
   on problem definition and the algorithm focuses on finding a solution,
   showing that the capacity of the generative approach to replace the
   designer is limited. In the paper, we first present the framework of
   generative design, then apply the process to a case study of designing
   an efficient shading solution, and in the end, we present the results
   and compare them with the traditional approach. The approach is general
   and can be applied in other areas of engineering. It is relevant both to
   designers as well as software developers who are expected to take this
   approach further. More theoretical work is needed to study problem
   definitions as a form of knowledge representation in engineering.},

   Better Prepared},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry is
   increasingly becoming digital and more prone to cyber-attacks. Although
   there are several studies and standards in the cybersecurity domain,
   experts suggest that domain-specific studies need to be conducted to
   address the unique challenges faced within each of the different
   industries. Therefore, several cybersecurity studies have been
   undertaken for various industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing,
   telecommunication, and energy. However, this type of study is largely
   missing in the AEC industry due to different reasons, including lack of
   awareness. To address that, this study aims to (a) compare and analyze
   the number of cybersecurity-related documents in the AEC industry with
   several other industries, and (b) extract and analyze the
   cybersecurity-related documents data to identify potential future
   research trends and topics for the AEC community. The Web of Science
   (WOS) database, consisting of significant and influential journal
   publications, was used for document retrieval. VOSviewer was used to
   identify key research topics and trends in the cybersecurity domain and
   define future cybersecurity research in the AEC industry. WOS document
   retrieval results that compared the total number of publications
   corroborated the little to no attention received to cybersecurity
   investigation in the AEC industry. In addition, the VOSviewer analysis
   revealed three significant areas of research in the cybersecurity
   community that provide a reasonably justified roadmap for conducting
   cybersecurity research in the AEC industry. This study could greatly
   benefit the AEC research community and potential reaping benefits to the
   industry by creating more awareness among different stakeholders.},

   lifecycle of the construction industry: A comprehensive review},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},

Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The construction industry faces many challenges, including schedule and
   cost overruns, productivity constraints, and workforce shortages.
   Compared to other sectors, it lags in digitalization in every project
   phase. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have
   emerged as transformative technologies revolutionizing the construction
   sector. However, a discernible gap persists in systematically
   categorizing the applications of these technologies throughout the
   various phases of the construction project life cycle. In response to
   this gap, this research aims to present a thorough assessment of the
   deployment of AI and ML across diverse phases in construction projects,
   with the ultimate goal of furnishing valuable insights for the effective
   integration of these intelligent systems within the construction sector.
   A thorough literature review was performed to identify AI and ML
   applications in the building sector. After scrutinizing the literature,
   the applications of AI and ML were presented based on a construction
   project life cycle. A critical review of existing literature on AI and
   ML applications in the building industry showed that AI and ML
   applications are more frequent in the planning and construction stages.
   Moreover, the opportunities for AI and ML applications in other stages
   were discussed based on the life cycle categorization and presented in
   this study. The practical contribution of the study lies in providing
   valuable insights for the effective integration of intelligent systems
   within the construction sector. Academically, the research contributes
   by conducting a thorough literature review, categorizing AI and ML
   applications based on the construction project life cycle, and
   identifying opportunities for their deployment in different stages.},

Title = {Semi-Automated Segmentation of Geometric Shapes from Point Clouds},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building information models (BIM) in the civil industry are very popular
   nowadays. The basic information of these models is the 3D geometric
   model of a building structure. The most applied methodology to model the
   existing buildings is by generating 3D geometric information from point
   clouds provided by laser scanners. The fundamental principle of this
   methodology is the recognition of structures shaped in basic geometric
   primitives, e.g., planes, spheres, and cylinders. The basic premise of
   the efficiency of this methodology is the automation of detection, since
   manual segmentation of a point cloud can be challenging, time-consuming,
   and, therefore, inefficient. This paper presents a novel algorithm for
   the automated segmentation of geometric shapes in point clouds without
   needing pre-segmentation. With the designed algorithm, structures formed
   in three types of basic geometrical primitive can be identified and
   segmented: planar (e.g., walls, floors, ceilings), spherical (e.g.,
   laser scanner reference targets), and cylindrical (e.g., columns,
   pillars, piping). The RANSAC paradigm partially inspires the proposed
   algorithm; however, various modifications must be made. The algorithm
   was tested on several point clouds and was compared with the standard
   RANSAC algorithm; this part is described in the last section of the
   paper. One of the tests was performed on a double cylinder-shaped test
   object, the parameters (radius and height) of this object were available
   with high accuracy (0.1 mm), and the differences between the known and
   estimated parameters were below 0.5 mm in each case, indicating the
   correctness of the proposed algorithm. Also, a comparison with the
   standard RANSAC algorithm was performed, where the algorithm proposed
   showed better results than the standard RANSAC algorithm. The
   segmentation quality was, on average, increased from 50\% to 100\%.},

   Modeling Software: Affordances of Detection and Segmentation},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Building owners are working on converting their legacy documentation 2D
   floor plans into digital 3D representations, but the manual process is
   labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, deep learning is
   leveraged to automate the process. This automation requires
   interoperability between artificial neural networks and prevailing 3D
   modeling software. The system processes 2D floor plans and outputs
   parameters of recognized walls, single doors, double doors, and columns.
   The parameters include the start point and end point of the wall and the
   center point of the door and column. These parameters are input into
   Revit 2022 through the Revit API 2022 after post-processing. The
   dimensional parameter integration affordances of object detection and
   instance segmentation are studied and compared using Faster R-CNN and
   Mask R-CNN models. Instance segmentation was found to require more time
   for data labeling but was more capable of informing the modeling of
   irregularly shaped objects. The mean Average Precision (mAP) of object
   detection and instance segmentation are 71.7\% and 69.3\%, respectively.
   Apart from single doors, the average precision for other categories
   falls within the range of 74\% to 96\%. The results provide software
   developers with guidance on choosing between object detection and
   instance segmentation strategies for processing legacy building
   documents. These types of systems are anticipated to be pivotal to the
   industry's transition from 2D to 3D information modalities and advise
   practitioners to carefully choose suitable models and consider the
   recommendations provided in this study to mitigate potential failure
   cases.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) creates a revolutionary opportunity for the smart
   ports' authorities, with the capability of high-fidelity digital
   representation of real-world things. DT-driven management is able to
   predict potential risk, it is considered to be a key integration
   involves transport and operation related with smart port supply chains.
   This paper presents DT information visualizations \& outcome loop of
   global smart ports' management, and core technique towards smart ports'
   processes based on DT-driven management. A systematic framework of
   DT-based model for smart port's management is presented, which can be
   categorized into physical layer, data layer, model layer, service layer
   and application layer. Decision-makers engage in operational management
   through the DT-based models and platform. To illustrate DT mechanism,
   multi-aspect functional applications of DT-driven management are
   discussed, including cargo handling and transportation, containers
   operation and storage, data communication and sharing, risk prediction,
   and environmental protection in global smart ports. Meanwhile, this
   paper proposes concerned challenges of DT-driven management integrated
   with optimized cross-platform in smart ports' processes, to indicate
   there are barriers ahead to get to an ideal visual-based management
   system. Current challenges help decision-makers to determine where to
   find a proper strategy to win, in the future, DT visual applications can
   be extended in several directions of global port industry. This work
   contributes to address a comprehensive overview of DT managing
   capabilities together with details of necessary architecture to support
   effective simulations in virtual port's space. It provides DT-driven
   platform will enable better management across the smart port activities
   from design to transport to operation and sustainment of innovative

   industry since 2014 due to its wide range of applications. AM promotes a
   more automated, innovative, flexible, and sustainable construction
   method, making it an integral part of the Construction Industry 4.0.
   However, there need to be more detailed studies regarding the
   effectiveness of AM as the future direction in the construction
   industry. This paper investigates the application of the finite element
   method (FEM) in assessing 3D-printed structures to get insight into the
   performance of these structures. Three leading 3D-printed structures
   were selected, including Dubai Future Foundation in the United Arab
   Emirates, Apis Cor house in Russia and PERI house in Germany. Structural
   and thermal analyses, including linear static, natural frequency,
   spectral response, and steady state heat, were performed using Strand7
   to assess the effectiveness of AM in construction and the reliability of
   FEM in analysing 3D-printed structures. Although there are limited
   standards and regulations for 3D-printed structures in most countries,
   it was concluded that 3D-printed structures presented a similar strength
   to traditional ones. Moreover, FEM can be used to provide a reasonable
   analysis of the performance of these structures, while complying with
   the relevant standards. This paper presents a novel numerical procedure
   to assess the performance of small-scale 3D-printed structures under
   various mechanical and thermal loadings by checking against the relevant
   standards.},

   CONSTRUCTION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},

Pages = {505-525},
Abstract = {The construction industry continues to seek innovative ways to safely,
   timely and cost-effectively deliver construction projects. Several
   efforts have been made to automate construction processes but marginial
   success has been achieved in effectively reducing the long standing
   risks suffered by the industry. While industry 4.0 promises to improve
   project efficiency, reduce waste and improve productivity, the
   transition to this will depend on the successful adoption of many
   emerging technologies such as virtual design modeling technologies,
   sensing technologies, data analysis, storage and communication
   technologies, human-computer interaction technologies, and robotics. To
   accelerate innovation, digital twins and cyber physical systems will be
   a necessity to advance automation and real-time control with these
   technologies. While digital twin represents a digital replica of the
   asplanned and as-built facility, cyber physical systems involve
   integration of physical systems with their digital replica through
   sensors and actuators. Despite evidence of the efficacy of
   cyber-physical systems and digital twins for reducing non fatal
   injuries, enhancing safety management, improving progress monitoring and
   enhancing performance monitoring and control of facilities, their
   adoption in the construction industry is still in its infancy. This
   paper sheds light on the opportunities offered by cyber-physical systems
   and digital twins in other industry sectors and advocates for their
   increased deployment in the construction industry. This paper describes
   cyber-physical integration of emerging technologies with the physical
   construction or constructed facility as the next generation digital twin
   and cyber-physical systems. Potential scenarios of next generation cyber
   physical system and digital twin for improving workforce productivity,
   health, and safety, lifecycle management of building systems, and
   workforce competency are presented.},

Title = {Economy-energy trade off automation - A decision support system for
   building design development},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Building energy simulation is traditionally applied at late phases of
   the design, when most decisions on specifications of building systems
   are made. There has been a growing attempt in the literature to enable
   such simulations at earlier phases of design, when decisions' impact on
   the lifecycle behavior is the strongest. While researchers have
   developed tools/models to support planning and conceptualization phases
   from this aspect; there have been not much developments for early design
   development stage (which is usually the scope of semi-detailed cost
   estimates). This paper introduces a software tool for generating
   multiple design scenarios and evaluating them, by combining energy
   simulation and economic analyses, at schematic design and early design
   development phases of building projects. In this regard, we used
   state-of-the art of open source technologies, as well as cloud
   computing, to integrate energy simulation into the alternative selection
   procedure. The developed system focuses on architectural parameters;
   lighting power density; and heating, ventilation and air conditioning
   (HVAC). Analysis of sensitivity of lifecycle energy to such parameters,
   in a group of representative real-world projects, helped us to limit
   variations of such parameters, and subsequently their combinations.
   Using Open-Studio measures and the computational power offered by the
   cloud, our system generates/simulates all possible design scenarios
   (combinations of alternative variations for design parameters); and
   compares them based on building economics performance measures. The
   workflow is showcased in a case study project, by automatically creating
   and evaluating 97 design scenarios, based on economic efficiency and
   liquidity.},

Abstract = {Purpose The aim of this paper is to synthesize knowledge related to
   performance evaluation of automated construction processes during the
   planning and execution phases through a theme-based literature
   classification. The primary research question that is addressed is ``How
   to quantify the performance improvement in automated construction
   processes?{''} Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature
   review of papers on automated construction was conducted involving three
   stages-planning, conducting and reporting. In the planning stage, the
   purpose of the review is established through key research questions.
   Then, a four-step process is employed consisting of identification,
   screening, shortlisting and inclusion of papers. For reporting,
   observations were critically analysed and categorized according to
   themes. Findings The primary conclusion from this study is that the
   effectiveness of construction processes can only be benchmarked using
   realistic simulations. Simulations help to pinpoint the root causes of
   success or failure of projects that are either already completed or
   under execution. In automated construction, there are many complex
   interactions between humans and machines; therefore, detailed simulation
   models are needed for accurate predictions. One key requirement for
   simulation is the calibration of the models using real data from
   construction sites. Research limitations/implications This study is
   based on a review of 169 papers from a database of peer-reviewed
   journals, within a time span of 50 years. Originality/value Gap in
   research in the area of performance evaluation of automated construction
   is brought out. The importance of simulation models calibrated with
   on-site data within a methodology for performance evaluation is
   highlighted.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Smart Readiness Indicator for Educational Buildings},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) is an assessment scheme for the
   intelligence of buildings, which was introduced by the European
   Commission in the directive for the Energy Performance of Buildings in
   2018. Since its introduction, many activities related to the maturation
   and employment of the SRI have been initiated. One of the adaptation
   needs of the SRI, revealed through public consultation with relevant
   stakeholders, is the requirement for a tailored SRI for different types
   of buildings. The aim of this study is to analyze possible scenarios to
   optimize the smartness performance, as addressed by the SRI score, in
   educational buildings. The subject of this study concerned campus
   buildings of the Kaunas University of Technology, in Lithuania. For the
   definition of the SRI, the calculation sheet developed by the European
   Commission was used. The effect of the improvements in the smartness
   performance of buildings on their energy efficiency was examined with
   the use of a whole-building, BIM-based energy assessment tool (IDA-ICE).
   The findings of this study revealed that despite the improvement in the
   automation and control levels of the building heating system, the
   maximum SRI values achieved deviate significantly by a high-smartness
   level. This study revealed the importance of services at a city level
   towards achieving the optimal smartness levels at a building unit level.
   It also delivered useful findings related to the linkage between energy
   and smartness performance of a building. The policy implication of the
   study findings also covers topics relevant to utilities management at a
   district level, as well as on the need for tailored SRI services
   catalogs for different types of buildings.},

Title = {Design Optimization of Reinforced Concrete Cantilever Retaining Walls: A
   State-of-the-Art Review},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {The booming growth of computational abilities in the 21st century has
   led to its assimilation and benefit in all horizons of engineering. For
   civil engineers, these advancements have led to groundbreaking
   technologies such as BIM, automation, and optimization. Unfortunately,
   even in an era of dwindling resources and dire need for sustainability,
   optimization has failed to attract implementation in practice. Despite
   an exponential growth as an area of research interest, the optimization
   of engineering structures such as reinforced concrete (RC) is still a
   complex task that requires multidisciplinary knowledge, hindering its
   practicability. Although past review papers have delved into this topic,
   they have only been able to cover the breadth of information available
   by covering broader aspects of optimization of structures. This study on
   the other hand aims to cover this topic in depth to uncover problem
   specific trends and issues, by focusing only on optimization of RC
   cantilever retaining walls. Although there is an abundance of research
   studies on this topic, there is an absence of any critical review to tie
   them up, and concurrently with its broader scope, it suffers the same
   lack of applicability in the field. The in-depth review presents a
   summarization of all the online publications including research
   articles, conference papers, and theses to the best of authors'
   knowledge on the topic of RC cantilever retaining wall optimization.
   Geographical trends, regional developments, and prominent journals have
   been identified. The design codes, problem formulation, objectives,
   constraints, variables, and their optimization techniques are tabulated
   for ease of understanding. Unique areas of development investigated by
   the different researchers have been highlighted. Lastly, comprehensive
   recommendations for future works have been detailed with a focus on
   improving its applicability and assimilation into the construction
   industry.},

   Delivery Projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {151},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {As digital technologies transform the built environment industry, the
   integrated digital delivery (IDD) initiative has emerged as a key
   approach to enhance project coordination, productivity, and
   sustainability. Despite the growing adoption of digital solutions,
   construction organizations lack effective tools to evaluate the
   digitalization level of IDD projects. While various frameworks exist for
   assessing organizational and industry-level digital maturity, there
   remains a significant gap in project-level assessment approaches,
   hindering organizations' ability to measure implementation progress and
   make informed technology decisions. This study aims to develop an
   IDD-digitalization assessment system (IDD-DAS) to measure the extent of
   digital implementation in IDD projects. A total of 31 digital
   activities, serving as key assessment indicators, were identified across
   four IDD project phases through literature review and expert validation.
   The fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) method was employed to develop the
   IDD-DAS. The system was validated through three case studies across
   residential, commercial, and infrastructure projects, demonstrating its
   effectiveness and practical applicability. The findings revealed that
   the four project phases are equally important in determining the overall
   digital maturity, emphasizing the necessity for a holistic and
   integrated approach to digital innovation in the built environment
   industry. The identification of key digital activities within the four
   digital phases underscores the critical role of digital data management
   and collaboration platforms in IDD projects. This study advances the
   body of knowledge by developing a comprehensive project-level
   digitalization assessment system with systematically validated
   indicators that capture digital implementation across IDD project
   phases. The findings advance digital transformation practices in the
   global built environment industry, supporting organizations toward
   enhanced efficiency and innovation.},

Title = {Financial Digital Twin for Public Sector Capital Projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {As facility owners and operators, public sector organizations (such as
   government agencies) that provide public facilities and services not
   only maintain the existing capital assets but also plan for future
   developments on an ongoing basis through a capital improvement program
   (CIP). The CIP identifies capital projects and is typically funded
   through several distinct funding sources with specific usage, timing,
   and reporting restrictions. The continuous nature of capital improvement
   planning compounded by the potential for scope or funding availability
   changes further makes it a challenge to retain the flexibility to add
   new and different funding sources to an existing funding allocation
   plan. Existing literature about this problem is sparse, and a systemic
   solution is yet to be proposed that enables an owner organization to
   meet its goals while maintaining fiscal responsibility toward its
   funding agencies. The financial digital twin (FinDT) framework developed
   in this study integrates fund allocation and accounting with project
   acquisition in real time and enables the owner to automate funding
   allocation tasks and to synchronize change management while ensuring
   compliance with funding restrictions. The goal of this framework is to
   leverage rule-based knowledge management to consolidate and continually
   optimize the efficient use of accurate financial information at all
   stages of the capital asset lifecycle. This is accomplished through
   automation and digital twin (DT) integration. A use case was developed
   to demonstrate and evaluate the FinDT, which was found to hold potential
   for more efficient information management and support for decision
   making through enterprise-level data integration. The framework
   developed in this study can be used to display other nongeometric
   attribute information in a building information model for the purposes
   of visualization and interactive, efficient decision making.},

Title = {Augmented and Virtual Reality in Construction: Drivers and Limitations
   for Industry Adoption},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Augmented and virtual reality have the potential to provide a
   step-change in productivity in the construction sector; however, the
   level of adoption is very low. This paper presents a systematic study of
   the factors that limit and drive adoption in a construction
   sector-specific context. A mixed research method was employed, combining
   qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. Eight focus
   groups with 54 experts and an online questionnaire were conducted.
   Forty-two limiting and driving factors were identified and ranked.
   Principal component analysis was conducted to group the identified
   factors into a smaller number of factors based on correlations. Four
   types of limiting factors and four types of driving factors were
   identified. The main limitation of adoption is that AR and VR
   technologies are regarded as expensive and immature technologies that
   are not suitable for engineering and construction. The main drivers are
   that AR and VR enable improvements in project delivery and provision of
   new and better services. This study provides valuable insights to
   stakeholders to devise actions that mitigate the limiting factors and
   that boost the driving factors. This is one of the first systematic
   studies to present a detailed analysis of the factors that limit and
   drive adoption of AR and VR in the construction industry. The main
   contribution of this study is that it grouped and characterized myriad
   limiting and driving factors into easily understandable categories, so
   that the limiting factors can be effectively mitigated and the driving
   factors potentiated. A roadmap with specific short-term and medium-term
   actions for improving adoption was outlined.},

Title = {Design Application and Evolution of 3D Visualization Technology in
   Architectural Heritage Conservation: A CiteSpace-Based Knowledge Mapping
   and Systematic Review (2005-2024)},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {This study integrates quantitative scientometric analysis with a
   qualitative systematic review to comprehensively examine the evolution,
   core research themes, and emerging trends of three-dimensional (3D)
   visualization technology in architectural heritage conservation from
   2005 to 2024. A total of 813 relevant publications were retrieved from
   the Web of Science Core Collection and analyzed using CiteSpace to
   construct a detailed knowledge map of the field. The findings highlight
   that foundational technologies such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS),
   photogrammetry, building information modeling (BIM), and heritage
   building information modeling (HBIM) have laid a solid technical
   foundation for accurate heritage documentation and semantic
   representation. At the same time, the integration of digital twins, the
   Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and immersive
   technologies has facilitated a shift from static documentation to
   dynamic perception, real-time analysis, and interactive engagement. The
   analysis identifies four major research domains: (1) 3D data acquisition
   and modeling techniques, (2) digital heritage documentation and
   information management, (3) virtual reconstruction and interactive
   visualization, and (4) digital transformation and cultural narrative
   integration. Based on these insights, this study proposes four key
   directions for future research: advancing intelligence and automation in
   3D modeling workflows; enhancing cross-platform interoperability and
   semantic standardization; realizing the full lifecycle management of
   architectural heritage; and enhancing cultural narratives through
   digital expression. This study provides a systematic and in-depth
   understanding of the role of 3D visualization in architectural heritage
   conservation. It offers a solid theoretical foundation and strategic
   guidance for technological innovation, policy development, and
   interdisciplinary collaboration in the digital heritage field.},

Title = {Automatic assembly of prefabricated components based on vision-guided
   robot},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {162},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {On-site assembly of prefabricated components is crucial for the
   construction efficiency and quality of prefabricated buildings. In this
   process, a prefabricated component is first lifted and transported to
   the vicinity, where it will be installed using a crane. Subsequently,
   multiple workers collaborate to align the components with the target
   installation area. However, this manual installation method is
   time-consuming and unreliable in accuracy. A vision-based robot-assisted
   component installation system is proposed in this study. After the
   initial alignment using a crane, the two robots cooperate to adjust the
   position and orientation of the component accurately. This automated
   assembly method consists of the following tasks: (1) The target
   installation pose of the component, which can be used as a guide for the
   movements of robots, is extracted from the building information model
   (BIM) based on the industry foundation class standard. (2) An
   optical-marker-based method is applied to position the robots in the
   coordinate system of the site and identify the pose of the reserved hole
   in the lifting prefabricated component. Based on this pose, the robot is
   manipulated to thread the end effector into the reserved hole. (3) A
   planned working path of the end effector in Cartesian space combined
   with the current pose of the end effector and the target installation
   pose is obtained. (4) The end effector moves along a predetermined path
   to drive the component precisely. Finally, the accuracy, feasibility,
   and effectiveness of the robotic automated construction method are
   verified through installation tests on a precast panel.},

Title = {Novel comprehensive unified classification system toward smart
   standardized built environment knowledge and low-risk international
   collaborations: UniCCC},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {305},
Month = {DEC 3},
Abstract = {The Construction Industry (CI) data is acknowledged to still be
   unstructured and high-dimensional. Efforts were undertaken to tackle
   this problem using regional Unified Classification Systems (UCSs). The
   study emphasizes the necessity for a comprehensive international UCS to
   manage the growing trend of international collaborations within the CI
   and associated data risks. Existing UCSs exhibit significant
   inconsistencies, such as regional omissions, terminological disparities,
   and diverse data structuring, underscoring the need for a unified
   approach. Accordingly, using a 3-stage mixed method, the novel UCS `
   Unified Classification of Construction Components\_ UniCCC' ` was
   developed, comprising 4 phyla, 9 divisions, and 54 classes, and was
   shown to have good adaptability/scalability, structure/breakdown,
   clarity, codifiability, and inclusivity of the 11 key CI aspects. By
   addressing inconsistencies and smartly structuring CI knowledge from
   North America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, using a faceted
   classification scheme aligned with ISO 12,006, and being developed using
   a conventional modeling language, UniCCC represents a significant
   advancement in UCSs, with promising implications for global CI practices
   and research, paving the way for new avenues in CI performance,
   innovation, and sustainability. It demonstrated efficiency in various CI
   aspects, including risk reduction, automation, and sustainability
   enhancement. As evidence of its performance, using UniCCC for scheduling
   might decrease up to 58.17\%, 66.85\%, and 31.74\% of the related time,
   request for information, and omissions, respectively. The study suggests
   future research perspectives to explore UniCCC's applicability in
   different regions, its integration with emerging technologies, its
   proficiency metrics for different purposes, and strategies for
   organizational implementation.},

Title = {Evaluating the Digital Transformation Potential in Pre-Construction for
   Sustainable Practices Using Structural Equation Modeling},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study presents the development of a comprehensive model for
   evaluating the level of readiness of buildings for digital
   transformation during the pre-construction phase. The proposed model
   utilizes structural equation modeling (SEM) and includes a full list of
   key factors for achieving success. This tool is designed to support
   industry stakeholders in assessing operational efficiency in terms of
   digital transformation readiness in the pre-construction phase (DTRPC)
   and analyze the effectiveness and limitations of DTRPC across various
   management levels. Key success factors were identified through
   interviews with experts and a review of the relevant literature. These
   variables were then validated through two rounds of the 8 Delphi
   technique, which included the input of 13 highly qualified experts.
   Finally, an online questionnaire was disseminated to industry
   professionals, who assessed the factors' relative levels of
   significance. Questionnaire responses were collected from a sample of
   300 individuals from different professional fields. SEM was then used to
   quantitatively analyze the relationships between the various components
   of the DTRPC success factors. The goal was to determine the impact of
   each construct on the overall level of readiness. The model underwent a
   thorough evaluation to determine its strength and stability across
   several parameters, including accuracy, conformity to multivariate
   normalcy, and reliability and validity. A hypothesis analysis was also
   conducted. The collected data were used to develop the proposed DTRPC
   model, consisting of 30 essential performance indicators grouped into
   four categories. The use of SEM uncovered a significant correlation
   between the operational indicators of these critical factors and the
   construct groups, as well as the influence of effective DTRPC constructs
   on overall project performance. This research expands the current
   knowledge by identifying important indications for evaluating the
   success of the DTRPC model and using them to create a comprehensive
   global SEM that can be used as a tool for measuring readiness at the
   pre-construction stage. This has the potential to provide essential
   assistance to organizations, project managers, and policymakers in
   making informed decisions.},

Title = {Simulation optimisation towards energy efficient green buildings:
   Current status and future trends},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {254},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The increasing global importance of climate change has been clearly
   recognised in the last few years. The building industry contributed to a
   large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across
   material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing
   computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle
   environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There
   were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in
   various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the
   optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their
   strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges.
   Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the
   computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life
   cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim
   of identifying the current practices and future research need in this
   field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative
   structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were
   compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that
   come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the
   consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building
   systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the
   future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging
   digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and
   parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design
   exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As
   human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become
   important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design
   should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass
   both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {Effective Motion Sensors and Deep Learning Techniques for Unmanned
   Ground Vehicle (UGV)-Based Automated Pavement Layer Change Detection in
   Road Construction},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As-built progress of the constructed pavement should be monitored
   effectively to provide prompt project control. However, current pavement
   construction progress monitoring practices (e.g., data collection,
   processing, and analysis) are typically manual, time-consuming, tedious,
   and error-prone. To address this, this study proposes sensors mounted
   using a UGV-based methodology to develop a pavement layer change
   classifier measuring pavement construction progress automatically.
   Initially, data were collected using the UGV equipped with a laser ToF
   (time-of-flight) distance sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS
   sensor in a controlled environment by constructing various scenarios of
   pavement layer change. Subsequently, four Long Short-Term Memory network
   variants (LSTMs) (LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and ConvLSTM) were implemented
   on collected sensor data combinations for developing pavement layer
   change classifiers. The authors conducted the experiment to select the
   best sensor combinations for feature detection of the layer change
   classifier model. Subsequently, individual performance measures of each
   class with learning curves and confusion matrices were generated using
   sensor combination data to find out the best algorithm among all
   implemented algorithms. The experimental result demonstrates the (a(z) +
   g(x) + D) sensor combination as the best feature detector with
   high-performance measures (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score).
   The result also confirms the ConvLSTM as the best algorithm with the
   highest overall accuracy of 97.88\% with (a(z) + g(x) + D) sensor
   combination data. The high-performance measures with the proposed
   approach confirm the feasibility of detecting pavement layer changes in
   real pavement construction projects. This proposed approach can
   potentially improve the efficiency of road construction progress
   measurement. This research study is a stepping stone for automated road
   construction progress monitoring.},

Title = {Unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) based automated construction progress
   measurement of road using LSTM},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 4},
Abstract = {PurposeCurrent solutions for monitoring the progress of pavement
   construction (such as collecting, processing and analysing data) are
   inefficient, labour-intensive, time-consuming, tedious and error-prone.
   In this study, an automated solution proposes sensors prototype mounted
   unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) for data collection, an LSTM classifier
   for road layer detection, the integrated algorithm for as-built progress
   calculation and web-based as-built
   reporting.Design/methodology/approachThe crux of the proposed solution,
   the road layer detection model, is proposed to develop from the layer
   change detection model and rule-based reasoning. In the beginning, data
   were gathered using a UGV with a laser ToF (time-of-flight) distance
   sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS sensor in a controlled
   environment. The long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm was utilised on
   acquired data to develop a classifier model for layer change detection,
   such as layer not changed, layer up and layer down.FindingsIn controlled
   environment experiments, the classification of road layer changes
   achieved 94.35\% test accuracy with 14.05\% loss. Subsequently, the
   proposed approach, including the layer detection model, as-built
   measurement algorithm and reporting, was successfully implemented with a
   real case study to test the robustness of the model and measure the
   as-built progress.Research limitations/implicationsThe implementation of
   the proposed framework can allow continuous, real-time monitoring of
   road construction projects, eliminating the need for manual,
   time-consuming methods. This study will potentially help the
   construction industry in the real time decision-making process of
   construction progress monitoring and controlling
   action.Originality/valueThis first novel approach marks the first
   utilization of sensors mounted UGV for monitoring road construction
   progress, filling a crucial research gap in incremental and segment-wise
   construction monitoring and offering a solution that addresses
   challenges faced by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and 3D
   reconstruction. Utilizing UGVs offers advantages like
   cost-effectiveness, safety and operational flexibility in no-fly zones.},

Title = {Critical Factors Affecting the Promotion of Emerging Information
   Technology in Prefabricated Building Projects: A Hybrid Evaluation Model},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Emerging information technology (EIT), characterized by intelligence,
   digitization, and automation, can facilitate activities such as
   stakeholder cooperation, information management, and construction
   management to enhance the overall performance in prefabricated building
   projects (PBPs). A variety of EITs are currently being used in PBPs, but
   their development is relatively sluggish and still in the infancy stage.
   Previous studies have explored the challenges and barriers of EIT in
   PBPs; however, the correlations between these factors have not been
   thoroughly examined. Therefore, the goal of this study is to pinpoint
   the characteristics and connections between EIT-affecting elements.
   Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, this
   study firstly summarizes 20 influencing factors of EIT adoption and
   promotion in PBPs mentioned in the previous literature through a
   literature review. Then, EIT experts were invited to conduct
   semi-structured interviews to evaluate the relationship and the degree
   of influence among 20 influencing factors. Finally, the DEMATEL-ISM
   approach was used to assess the characteristics of each factor and the
   hierarchy between them. The results demonstrated that the influencing
   degree of the environmental dimension was more significant and had a
   greater influence on the whole network of influencing factors. The
   factors of the organizational dimension have a higher influenced degree
   and are easily influenced by other factors. Due to the current lack of
   awareness of EIT, the majority of the technology-related influencing
   factors have a less significant effect on adopting and promoting EIT. In
   summary, this study assists in analyzing the characteristics and
   correlations of the factors that influence EIT adoption and promotion in
   PBPs and identifies critical influencing factors. It also aids the
   government and stakeholders in developing a deeper understanding and
   knowledge of EIT, thereby promoting the development of EIT in PBPs.},

Title = {Exploring job competency related to intelligent construction in China
   using a text mining method},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 26},
Abstract = {PurposeThe construction industry is experiencing digital transformation,
   which is also defined as intelligent construction. With the rise of
   intelligent construction, job characteristics are changing rapidly.
   Current knowledge about job competencies required by intelligent
   construction is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore
   job competencies related to intelligent construction by text mining
   recruitment information. It is expected to reveal the trend of talent
   development for the intelligent construction
   industry.Design/methodology/approachA total of 375 job advertisements
   regarding the demanding professionals and industrial workers related to
   intelligent construction were collected and analyzed to reveal the
   demands of the current labor market. Different job posts related to
   intelligent construction were classified into 11 categories. Job
   competencies were extracted and analyzed using the latent Dirichlet
   allocation (LDA) model, frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)
   algorithm and k-means cluster analysis method. The text mining results
   identified 10 job competencies.FindingsCurrently, there was a high
   demand for high-tech talents in the labor market related to intelligent
   construction. Those high-tech job posts, such as software engineers and
   R\&D staff, required digital technology, R\&D skills, electrical
   automation knowledge and programming capability. Current employees
   demanding for intelligent construction are expected to be capable of
   both using information technology and having a general knowledge of the
   construction industry.Originality/valueThrough text mining of current
   job advertisements, the overall demand for compound talents in the labor
   market of intelligent construction were explored. The results provide
   empirical reference for personnel training and talent cultivation in the
   development of intelligent construction. Higher educational
   institutions, human resources professionals, as well as experts that are
   already employed or aspire to be employed in intelligent construction
   companies, would benefit from the results of our analysis.},

Title = {Integrating NLP and context-free grammar for complex rule interpretation
   towards automated compliance checking},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {142},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Automated rule checking (ARC) is expected to significantly promote the
   efficiency and compliance of design in the construction industry. The
   most vital and complex stage of ARC is interpreting the regulatory text
   into a computer-processable format. However, existing systems and
   studies of rule interpretation either require considerable
   time-consuming manual effort or are based on exhaustive enumerations of
   matching patterns with a limited scope of application. To address this
   problem, this research integrates natural language processing (NLP) and
   context-free grammar (CFG) to propose a novel generalized rule
   interpretation fra-mework, which can parse regulatory text like a
   domain-specific language. First, a syntax tree structure with several
   semantic elements is proposed to represent the roles and relations of
   concepts in regulatory text. Second, a deep learning model with the
   transfer learning technique is utilized to label the semantic ele-ments
   in a sentence. Finally, a set of CFGs is built to parse a labeled
   sentence into the language-independent tree structure, from which
   computable checking rules can be generated. Experimental results
   demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods: it
   achieves 99.6\% and 91.0\% accuracies for parsing single-and
   multi-requirement sentences, respectively, where the multi-requirement
   sentences are more complex and common but difficult for existing methods
   to deal with. This research contributes a method and framework for rule
   interpretation with both a high level of automation and wide scope of
   application, which can create computable rules from various textual
   regulatory documents. This research also publishes the first regulation
   dataset for future exploration, validation, and benchmarking in the ARC
   area.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Scoping Review for Cybersecurity in the Construction Industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},

Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The 4th industrial revolution and its inherent digitalization are
   changing every aspect of the construction industry. However, these
   technological transformations bring new challenges, including
   cybersecurity. Although a number of studies in recent years have aimed
   to analyze cybersecurity issues in the construction sector, further
   research investment in this area is vital. The first step towards
   identifying needed and promising research directions in this domain is
   to systematically analyze the existing body of knowledge and detect
   knowledge gaps. This study addresses this need through a systematic
   scoping review designed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Review
   (PRISMA-ScR). To synthesize the existing knowledge, the extracted
   information is mapped with multiple benchmarks, including the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework for cybersecurity
   management. The outcomes of the scoping review indicated that, from the
   construction perspective, the existing literature mainly focuses on a
   few areas, including Building Information Modeling (BIM), while other
   digital systems such as construction robots and prefabrication platforms
   need to be considered in future works. In terms of cybersecurity
   management, most of the existing studies focus on identifying risks and
   protecting assets. Other aspects of cybersecurity management, including
   detecting intrusions, responding to threats, and recovering from
   cyber-attacks need to be addressed in future studies. Regarding the
   technology-mediated countermeasures, the existing studies have explored
   only a limited number of potential solutions with a considerable focus
   on Blockchain-based systems, while the application of other
   countermeasures such as network virtualization can be a basis for future
   studies. Finally, the existing studies focused on procedural guidelines
   lack systematic solutions for areas including integrated cyber risk
   management and organizational change.},

Abstract = {Post-disaster reconstruction of the built environment represents a key
   global challenge that looks set to remain for the foreseeable future,
   but it also offers significant implications for the future
   sustainability and resilience of the built environment. The purpose of
   this research is to explore the current applications of advanced
   digital/Industry 4.0 technologies in the post-disaster reconstruction
   (PDR) process with a view to improving its effectiveness and efficiency
   and the sustainability and resilience of the built environment. The
   extant research literature from the Scopus database on built environment
   reconstruction is identified and described. In a novel literature review
   approach, small language models are used for the classification and
   filtering of technology-related articles. A qualitative content analysis
   is then carried out to understand the extent to which Industry 4.0
   technologies are applied in current reconstruction practice, mapping
   their applications to specific phases of the PDR process and identifying
   dominant technologies and key trends in technology deployment. The study
   reveals a rapidly evolving landscape of technological innovation with
   transformative potential in enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness, and
   sustainability of rebuilding efforts, with dominant technologies
   including GIS, remote sensing, AI, and BIM. Key trends include
   increasing automation and data-driven decision-making, integration of
   multiple Industry 4.0/digital technologies, and a growing emphasis on
   incorporating community needs and local knowledge into reconstruction
   plans. The study highlights the need for future research to address key
   challenges, such as developing interoperable platforms, addressing the
   ethical implications of using AI and big data, and exploring the
   contribution of Industry 4.0/digital technologies to sustainable
   reconstruction practices.},

Title = {Demystifying the Influencing Factors of Construction 4.0 Technology
   Implementation from a Sustainability Starting Point: Current Trends and
   Future Research Roadmap},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Given the challenges of innovation and adaptation to change,
   Construction 4.0 (C4.0) is triggering a revolution within construction
   and industry firms from automation to a greater level of digitalization.
   Despite the plethora of advantages and growing research interest in
   certain aspects of C4.0 technology implementation (C4.0TeIm), previous
   discourses have been largely fragmented and lack a comprehensive
   investigation of the factors influencing C4.0TeIm. To this end, this
   study aims to holistically investigate the influencing factors of
   C4.0TeIm and propose guidelines for future research directions. Informed
   by the United Nations twin green and digital transition perspectives,
   this study initiated its exploration in the background by delving into
   the potential intersections between C4.0 and sustainability. To achieve
   the aim, this study (i) reviewed 77 relevant articles and discerned a
   comprehensive list of factors influencing C4.0TeIm; (ii) outlined and
   quantified the influence and importance of the identified factors using
   social network analysis and validated results against the simplified
   analysis; and (iii) revealed gaps in the literature and proposed a
   research roadmap directing future research needs. The results show that
   60 factors could collectively influence construction firms' C4.0TeIm;
   they can be categorized into the external environment, technology
   competence, organizational factors, project-based factors, and
   technology challenges. The findings also reveal that further endeavors
   should emphasize those understudied factors such as ``perceived overall
   organizational performance improvement{''}, ``corporate strategy and
   management policy{''}, and ``availability of resources{''}. Practically,
   the proposed research guidelines provide valuable references to
   accelerate C4.0TeIm in both academics and the business world and offer
   strategies for the top management of firms to maximize potential
   benefits and gain competitiveness.},

Title = {The Industrialisation of Sustainable Construction: A Transdisciplinary
   Approach to the Large-Scale Introduction of Compacted Mineral Mixtures
   (CMMs) into Building Construction},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Increasing demand for sustainable, resilient, and low-carbon
   construction materials has highlighted the potential of Compacted
   Mineral Mixtures (CMMs), which are formulated from various soil types
   (sand, silt, clay) and recycled mineral waste. This paper presents a
   comprehensive inter- and transdisciplinary research concept that aims to
   industrialise and scale up the adoption of CMM-based construction
   materials and methods, thereby accelerating the construction industry's
   systemic transition towards carbon neutrality. By drawing upon the
   latest advances in soil mechanics, rheology, and automation, we propose
   the development of a robust material properties database to inform the
   design and application of CMM-based materials, taking into account their
   complex, time-dependent behaviour. Advanced soil mechanical tests would
   be utilised to ensure optimal performance under various loading and
   ageing conditions. This research has also recognised the importance of
   context-specific strategies for CMM adoption. We have explored the
   implications and limitations of implementing the proposed framework in
   developing countries, particularly where resources may be constrained.
   We aim to shed light on socio-economic and regulatory aspects that could
   influence the adoption of these sustainable construction methods. The
   proposed concept explores how the automated production of CMM-based wall
   elements can become a fast, competitive, emission-free, and recyclable
   alternative to traditional masonry and concrete construction techniques.
   We advocate for the integration of open-source digital platform
   technologies to enhance data accessibility, processing, and knowledge
   acquisition; to boost confidence in CMM-based technologies; and to
   catalyse their widespread adoption. We believe that the transformative
   potential of this research necessitates a blend of basic and applied
   investigation using a comprehensive, holistic, and transfer-oriented
   methodology. Thus, this paper serves to highlight the viability and
   multiple benefits of CMMs in construction, emphasising their pivotal
   role in advancing sustainable development and resilience in the built
   environment.},

Abstract = {This paper elucidates an approach that utilizes generative artificial
   intelligence (AI) to develop alternative architectural design options
   based on local identity. The advancement of AI technologies has
   increasingly piqued the interest of the architecture, engineering,
   construction, and facility management industry. Notably, the topic of
   ``visualization{''} has gained prominence as a means for enhancing
   communication related to a project, especially in the early phases of
   design. This study aims to enhance the ease of obtaining design images
   during initial phases of design by drawing from multiple texts and
   images. It develops an additional training model to generate various
   design alternatives that resonate with the identity of the locale
   through the application of generative AI to the facade design of
   buildings. The identity of a locality in cities and regions is the
   capacity for the cities and regions to be identified and recognized as a
   specific area. Among the various visual elements of urban and regional
   landscapes, the front face of buildings may play a significant role in
   people's aesthetic perception and overall impression of the local
   environment. The research proposes an approach that transcends the
   conventional employment of three-dimensional modeling and rendering
   tools by readily deriving design alternatives that consider this local
   identity in commercial building remodeling. This approach allows for
   financial and temporal efficiency in the design communication phase of
   the initial architectural design process. The implementation and
   utilization of the proposed approach's supplementary training model in
   this study proceeds as follows: (i) image data are collected from the
   target area using open-source street-view resources and preprocessed for
   conversion to a trainable format; (ii) textual data are prepared for
   pairing with preprocessed image data; (iii) additional training and
   outcome testing are performed using varied text prompts and images; and
   (iv) the ability to generate building facade images that reflect the
   identity of the collected locale by using the additional trained model
   is determined, as evidenced by the findings of the proposed application
   method study. This enables the generation of design alternatives that
   integrate regional styles and diverse design requirements for buildings.
   The training model implemented in this study can be leveraged through
   weight adjustments and prompt engineering to generate a greater number
   of design reference images, among other diverse approaches.

Title = {Machine and Deep Learning Implementations for Heritage Building
   Information Modelling: A Critical Review of Theoretical and Applied
   Research},
Journal = {ACM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING AND CULTURAL HERITAGE},

Abstract = {Research domain and Problem: HBIM modelling from point cloud data has
   become a crucial research topic in the last decade since it is
   potentially considered as the central data model paving the way for the
   digital heritage practice beyond digitization. Reality Capture
   technologies such as terrestrial laser scanning, drone-mounted LiDAR
   sensors and photogrammetry enable the reality capture with a
   sub-millimetre accurate point cloud file that can be used as a reference
   file for Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM). However, HBIM
   modelling from the point cloud data of heritage buildings is mainly
   manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. Furthermore, image processing
   techniques are insufficient for classification and segmentation of point
   cloud data to speed up and enhance the current workflow for HBIM
   modelling. Due to the challenges and bottlenecks in the scan-to-HBIM
   process, which is commonly criticized as complex with its bespoke
   requirements, semantic segmentation of point clouds is gaining
   popularity in the literature. Research Aim and Methodology: Therefore,
   this paper aims to provide a thorough critical review of Machine
   Learning and Deep Learning methods for point cloud segmentation,
   classification, and BIM geometry automation for cultural heritage case
   study applications. Research findings: This paper files the challenges
   of HBIM practice and the opportunities for semantic point cloud
   segmentation found across academic literature in the last decade. Beyond
   definitions and basic occurrence statistics, this paper discusses the
   success rates and implementation challenges of machine and deep learning
   classification methods. Research value and contribution: This paper
   provides a holistic review of point cloud segmentation and its potential
   for further development and application in the Cultural Heritage sector.
   The critical analysis provides insight into the current state-of-the-art
   methods and advises on their suitability for HBIM projects. The review
   has identified highly original threads of research, which hold the
   potential to significantly influence practice and further applied
   research.},

Title = {Sharing Linked Building Data in a Peer-to-Peer Network: ifcOWL Meets
   InterPlanetary File System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The recent and significant change in the architecture, engineering, and
   construction (AEC) industry is the increasing use of building
   information management (BIM) tools in design and how the generated
   digital data are consumed. Although designers have primarily published
   blueprints and model files, multiple parties are now involved in
   producing different aspects of the data and may be consuming data
   produced by others. This evolution has created new challenges in sharing
   and synchronizing information across organizational boundaries. Linked
   building data is a community effort identified as a potential means of
   overcoming the barriers to data interoperability. In this paper, we
   present how the industry can be strengthened using a peer-to-peer
   network based on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) framework to
   address the typical availability problems of web-based data. The paper
   particularly presents how Linked Data serialization of the Industry
   Foundation Classes (IFC) standard can be used in the context of IPFS and
   benchmarks the performance for the publication of models between IPFS
   versus HTTP protocol. We show that linked building data-in particular,
   IFC models converted into Resource Description Format (RDF) graphs
   according to the ifcOWL ontology-can be implemented using the framework,
   with initial indications of significant benefits of a peer-to-peer
   network in terms of performance, offline access, and immutable version
   history. Two use cases in distributed collaborative environments in the
   AEC/facility management (FM) sector using evolving multidomain models
   are used to evaluate the work.
   In a construction project, stakeholders must collaborate and share
   design data models for efficient and safe completion. Building
   information published using Linked Data techniques aims to facilitate
   data sharing between interested parties without a central intermediary.
   However, the challenges of Linked Data stem from using web protocols,
   resulting in limited availability, suboptimal performance, broken links,
   and lost history. This study explores using the InterPlanetary File
   System (IPFS), a communication protocol for computers to communicate
   with each other directly without needing an intermediary. It addresses
   issues related to data availability on the web and data-transfer
   performance. The study demonstrates the suitability of IPFS in
   addressing the challenges of sharing building data. The data are
   available even when the original publisher host is down. In addition,
   the content-based addressing provides a digital fingerprint that can
   ensure authenticity and uniqueness, eliminating the data's duplication.
   Therefore, it minimizes the storage space consumed by data backups and
   archives. However, because IPFS addresses and communication principles
   are incompatible with the Linked Data standard approach, we designed a
   way so that the construction data saved in IPFS can be accessed
   transparently as a part of the standard Linked Data network.},

Title = {Features of Regulation Document Translation into a Machine-Readable
   Format within the Verification of Building Information Models},
Journal = {CIVILENG},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Pages = {373-390},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The transition to a design based on information modeling has paved the
   way for automated verification of project documentation. The most
   complicated type of design documentation check is the assessment of
   compliance with the requirements of regulatory documents since its
   automation requires the translation of statements written in natural
   language into a machine-readable format. At the same time, building
   codes and regulations should be suitable for translation into
   machine-readable form. However, a large number of provisions presented
   in regulatory documents cannot be subjected to automated verification
   due to their specific features. This study aimed to analyze the
   suitability of the regulatory provisions to be translated into a
   machine-readable format, identify limiting factors, and establish
   recommendations to avoid these factors. This study was conducted based
   on the example of the code of rules for ``Residential Apartment
   Buildings{''} (SP 54.13330.2016) applied in the Russian Federation.
   During the research, a previously developed algorithm that generates
   rules for checking building information models and is based on the
   RuleML language was applied to the provisions of the standard above to
   identify statements that can and cannot be translated. As a result, 356
   statements were received, which were divided into five groups:
   requirements suitable for translation into a machine-readable format,
   requirements containing links to other documents (regulatory and not
   only), requirements of uncertain interpretation, requirements that
   cannot be verified based on an information model, and informative
   requirements. For the first group of statements, there were examples
   given for both the statements and the rules derived from them. For the
   other four groups, examples of statements were supplied with factors
   preventing the translation of requirements into a machine-readable
   format and solutions on how to avoid these factors. An analysis of the
   distribution of statements (related to the above-mentioned groups) by
   sections of the standard showed that a significant part of the
   requirements is suitable for translation into a machine-readable format.
   The possible obstacles to translation can be overcome by attracting
   experts and using programming tools. The paper also makes
   recommendations on how to arrange new standard structures.},

Title = {Project Data Categorization, Adoption Factors, and Non-Functional
   Requirements for Blockchain Based Digital Twins in the Construction
   Industry 4.0},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {As key technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, blockchain and
   digital twins have great potential to enhance collaboration, data
   sharing, efficiency, and sustainability in the construction industry.
   Blockchain can improve data integrity and enhance trust in the data
   value chain throughout the entire lifecycle of projects. This paper aims
   to develop a novel theoretical framework for the adoption of
   environmentally sustainable blockchain-based digital twins (BCDT) for
   Construction Industry (CI) 4.0. The paper identifies which key data from
   construction projects lifecycle should be anchored in BCDTs to benefit
   CI 4.0 and the environment. The paper also identifies key factors and
   non-functional requirements necessary for the adoption of BCDTs in a
   decentralized and sustainable CI 4.0. At first, a content analysis of
   the literature allowed the identification of which data from projects
   lifecycle would benefit from blockchain technology (BCT) adoption and
   what the key factors and non-functional requirements necessary for the
   adoption of BCDT in the CI4.0 are. Furthermore, the analysis of
   structured interviews and online survey permitted to firstly validate
   the hypotheses raised from the literature and to offer a novel framework
   for BCDT of CI 4.0 in the context of the circular economy (CE). The
   findings are that (1) the key project lifecycle data relevant for BCDTs
   relate to the BIM dimensions (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, and 8D) and a new
   dimension called the contractual dimension (cD) is also proposed. (2)
   Ecosystems of BCDTs should embrace a novel form of collaboration that is
   decentralized and presented as Level 4 maturity for BCDTs. This new
   level of maturity leverages distributed blockchain networks to enhance
   collaboration, processes automation with smart contracts, and data
   sharing within a decentralized data value chain. Finally (3), the main
   non-functional requirements for BCDTs are security, privacy,
   interoperability, data ownership, data integrity, and the
   decentralization and scalability of data storage. With the proposed
   framework including the BCDT dimensions, the Maturity Level 4, and the
   key non-functional requirements, this paper provides the building blocks
   for industry practitioners to adopt BCDTs. This is promising for CI 4.0
   to embrace a paradigm shift towards decentralized ecosystems of united
   BCDTs where trust, collaboration, data sharing, information security,
   efficiency, and sustainability are improved throughout the lifecycle of
   projects and within a decentralized CE (DCE).},

Title = {Deep Learning-Based PC Member Crack Detection and Quality Inspection
   Support Technology for the Precise Construction of OSC Projects},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Recently, the construction industry has benefited from the increased
   application of smart construction led by the core technologies of the
   fourth industrial revolution, such as BIM, AI, modular construction, and
   AR/VR, which enhance productivity and work efficiency. In addition, the
   importance of ``Off-Site Construction (OSC){''}, a factory-based
   production method, is being highlighted as modular construction
   increases in the domestic construction market as a means of productivity
   enhancement. The problem with OSC construction is that the quality
   inspection of Precast Concrete (PC) members produced at the factory and
   brought to the construction site is not carried out accurately and
   systematically. Due to the shortage of quality inspection manpower, a
   lot of time and money is wasted on inspecting PC members on-site,
   compromising inspection efficiency and accuracy. In this study, the
   major inspection items to be checked during the quality inspection are
   classified based on the existing PC member quality inspection checklist
   and PC construction specifications. Based on the major inspection items,
   the items to which AI technology can be applied (for automatic quality
   inspection) were identified. Additionally, the research was conducted
   focusing on the detection of cracks, which are one of the major types of
   defects in PC members. However, accurate detection of cracks is
   difficult since the inspection mostly relies on a visual check coupled
   with subjective experience. To automate the detection of cracks for PC
   members, video images of cracks and non-cracks on the surface were
   collected and used for image training and recognition using
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and object detection, one of the deep
   learning technologies commonly applied in the field of image object
   recognition. Detected cracks were classified according to set thresholds
   (crack width and length), and finally, an automated PC member crack
   detection system that enables automatic crack detection based on mobile
   and web servers using deep learning and imaging technologies was
   proposed. This study is expected to enable more accurate and efficient
   on-site PC member quality inspection. Through the smart PC member
   quality inspection system proposed in this study, the time required for
   each phase of the existing PC member quality inspection work was
   reduced. This led to a reduction of 13 min of total work time, thereby
   improving work efficiency and convenience. Since quality inspection
   information can be stored and managed in the system database, human
   errors can be reduced while managing the quality of OSC work
   systematically and accurately. It is expected that through optimizing
   and upgrading our proposed system, quality work for the precise
   construction of OSC projects can be ensured. At the same time,
   systematic and accurate quality management of OSC projects is achievable
   through inspection data. In addition, the smart quality inspection
   system is expected to establish a smart work environment that enables
   efficient and accurate quality inspection practices if applied to
   various construction activities other than the OSC projects.},
